financialstatements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus.In addition to this summary, we urge you to read the entire prospectus carefully, especially the risks ofinvesting in our ADSs discussed under \"Risk Factors,\" before deciding whether to buy our ADSs.Our Business              We are the largest online direct sales company in China in terms of transaction volume in the third quarter of 2014, with a market share in China of51.9%, according to iResearch.Our GMV increased from RMB32.7 billion in 2011 to RMB73.3 billion in 2012 and RMB125.5 billion in 2013, and furtherto RMB213.5 billion (US$34.8 billion) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.We believe we provide consumers an enjoyable online retail experience.Through our content-rich and user-friendly website www.jd.com and mobileapplications, we offer a wide selection of authentic products at competitive prices which are delivered in a speedy and reliable manner.We also offerconvenient online and in-person payment options and comprehensive customer services.In order to have better control over fulfillment and to ensurecustomer satisfaction, we have built our own nationwide fulfillment infrastructure and last-mile delivery network, staffed by our own employees, whichsupports both our online direct sales and our online marketplace businesses.We have established strong relationships with our suppliers as we develop ouronline direct sales business.Leveraging our strengths, we launched our online marketplace business in 2010, which has allowed us to significantly expandour selection of products and services.As a result of our superior customer experience, our business has grown rapidly.As a result of the rapid growth of the number of products we offerthrough online direct sales and marketplace, electronic products and home appliances accounted for 80.1%, 65.3%, 63.6% and 56.9% of our total GMV in2011, 2012, 2013 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, respectively, and general merchandise and others for 19.9%, 34.7%, 36.4% and 43.1%.We foster an interactive user community that discusses, rates and reviews our products and services.We believe we have the largest online productreview database of any online direct sales company in China with approximately 426 million product reviews generated by our customers to date.We had12.5 million, 29.3 million, 47.4 million and 82.8 million active customer accounts and fulfilled approximately 65.9 million, 193.8 million, 323.3 million and582.9 million orders in 2011, 2012, 2013 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, respectively.Timely and reliable fulfillment is critical to the success of an online retail business.Given the underdevelopment of third-party fulfillment services inChina in terms of both warehousing and logistics facilities and last-mile delivery services, we made a strategic decision in 2007 to build and operate our ownnationwide fulfillment infrastructure.We believe we have the largest fulfillment infrastructure of any e-commerce company in China.We operated 118warehouses with an aggregate gross floor area of approximately 2.3 million square meters in 39 cities and 2,045 delivery stations and 1,045 pickup stationsin 1,855 counties and districts across China as of September 30, 2014, and had 31,603 delivery personnel, 11,530 warehouse staff and 7,673 customer servicepersonnel as of the same date.Leveraging this nationwide fulfillment infrastructure, we deliver a majority of the orders directly to customers ourselves, over80% of which were delivered on the day the order was placed or the day after.As of September 30, 2014, we provided same-day delivery in 130 counties anddistricts under our 211 program and next-day delivery in another 815 counties and districts across China.We are a technology-driven company and have invested heavily in developing our own highly scalable proprietary technology platform thatsupports our rapid growth and enables us to provide value-added technology services.In addition, our sophisticated business intelligence system enables us1Table of Contentsto refine our merchandise sourcing strategy to manage our inventory turnover and control costs and to leverage our large customer database to createcustomized product recommendations and cost-effective and targeted advertising.We introduced an online marketplace to leverage our brand recognition, large and growing customer base, extensive transaction data, fulfillmentinfrastructure and proprietary technology platform.Our online marketplace allows us to provide customers a much greater selection of products.Our onlinedirect sales and marketplace businesses together made us the second largest B2C e-commerce company in China, with a 19.3% market share based ontransaction volume in the third quarter of 2014, according to iResearch.We attract and select third-party sellers to offer authentic products to our customersthrough our online marketplace.We monitor third-party sellers' performance and activities on our online marketplace closely to ensure that they meet ourrequirements for authentic products and high-quality customer service.In addition to basic transaction processing and billing services, we offer third-partysellers a suite of value-added fulfillment and other services.Our business has grown substantially in recent years.Our total net revenues increased from RMB21.1 billion in 2011 to RMB41.4 billion in 2012and RMB69.3 billion in 2013, and increased from RMB49.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to RMB80.3 billion (US$13.1 billion) forthe nine months ended September 30, 2014.We had net losses of RMB1.3 billion, RMB1.7 billion, RMB0.05 billion and RMB4.5 billion (US$0.7 billion)in 2011, 2012, 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively.JD.com, Inc. is a holding company and does not directly own all of the entities through which we carry out our business operations.The PRCgovernment regulates foreign ownership and imposes licensing and permit requirements for companies that offer value-added telecommunications services,distribute books and audio and video products and provide online payment services.To comply with these restrictions, we operate our website and mobileapplications, sell books and audio and video products and provide online payment services through our variable interest entities in China.Our variableinterest entities contributed 2.2%, 3.2%, 2.9% and 3.0% of our consolidated total revenues in 2011, 2012, 2013 and the nine months ended September 30,2014, respectively.These variable interest entities hold the permits and licenses necessary for us to conduct our business in China.We face risks anduncertainties associated with our corporate structure, as our control over these variable interest entities is based on contractual arrangements rather thanequity ownership.See \"Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Corporate Structure\" and \"Corporate History and Structure.\"Our Industry              China's retail industry has experienced substantial growth as a result of rising disposable income and increasing urbanization.However, China's largesize and population and differences in consumer behavior and purchasing power across the country have presented significant challenges for retailers to scaleup and expand nationwide.As a result, China's retail industry is highly fragmented, with the top 20 retailers in aggregate only accounting for approximately12% of the total market share in 2013, as compared with approximately 40% in the United States, according to Euromonitor International.The fragmentedoffline retail market in China presents an opportunity for online retailers.According to iResearch, China's online retail market size measured by transaction volume was RMB1.9 trillion in 2013 and is expected to reachRMB5.6 trillion (US$922 billion) in 2017, representing a CAGR of 31.4%, a growth rate significantly faster than that of total retail sales.See \"Industry.\"2Table of Contents              Online direct sales and online marketplace are the two major online retail business models in China.Under the online direct sales business model, acompany procures and manages its own inventories, sells products directly to consumers online, and provides delivery and after-sales services.Under theonline marketplace business model, a company operates an intermediary platform that facilitates transactions between merchants and consumers.Someonline marketplaces are operated by companies that also have their own online direct sales business.China's online retail market was originally dominatedby online marketplaces, but companies operating under the online direct sales model with carefully managed procurement and fulfillment services as well aswide product selection have also been successful in the past several years, particularly as customers increasingly value product authenticity and betterservice.With the shortage of quality storage space and the limited availability of reasonably priced last-mile delivery options, fulfillment remains a challengefor online retail companies attempting to reach more consumers on a nationwide scale while maintaining the quality and efficiency of customer service.Competitive Strengths              We believe that the following competitive strengths contribute to our success and differentiate us from our competitors:•our leading market position as China's largest online direct sales company; •our superior customer experience; •our own nationwide fulfillment infrastructure; •our strong merchandise sourcing capabilities; •our highly scalable proprietary technology platform; •our fast growing online marketplace; and •our visionary founder, experienced management team and strong corporate culture.Our Strategies              Our goal is to become the largest e-commerce company in the world.We plan to achieve this goal by implementing strategies to optimize customerexperience, deepen our market penetration and enhance our brand recognition while continuing to improve our margins and operating leverage.Thesestrategies include:•attracting new customers and cultivating customer loyalty; •further expanding our product offerings; •enhancing our fulfillment infrastructure; •strengthening our technology platform; •improving operating leverage and increasing margins; and •exploring new business initiatives to broaden our service offerings.Our Challenges              Our ability to achieve our goal and execute our strategies is subject to risks and uncertainties, including those relating to our ability to:•manage our growth and execute our strategies effectively;3Table of Contents•achieve and maintain profitability; •provide superior customer experience; •protect our JD (  ) brand and reputation; •offer a broad selection of products at competitive prices; •further expand our fulfillment infrastructure and improve operational efficiency in a cost effective manner; •compete effectively; and •successfully integrate and manage our recently acquired businesses and assets into our existing business.In addition, we face risks and uncertainties related to our corporate structure and doing business in China, including:•risks associated with our control over Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou, which is based on contractual arrangements rather than equityownership; •uncertainties associated with the interpretation and application of PRC regulations and policies, including those relating to the online retailindustry and internet related business in China; and •risks related to our ability to use the proceeds of our initial public offering to make additional capital contributions or loans to our PRCsubsidiaries as a result of PRC regulations and governmental control of currency conversion.Please see \"Risk Factors\" and other information included in this prospectus for a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that we face.Transactions with Tencent              On March 10, 2014, we acquired certain e-commerce businesses and assets from, and entered into a strategic cooperation agreement and formed astrategic partnership with, Tencent Holdings Limited, or Tencent, a leading internet company serving the largest online community in China.Tencent offersa wide variety of internet services in China including instant messaging, social networking, online games and online media.As part of the strategicpartnership, Tencent agrees to offer us prominent level 1 access points in its mobile applications Weixin and Mobile QQ and provide internet traffic andother support from other key platforms to us.Level 1 access points refer to entries and links that Tencent users can directly access on the interfaces that willlaunch after one click on the home interface on Tencent's mobile applications.We launched level 1 access on Tencent's Weixin platform for selected Weixinusers in Beijing and Shanghai first in May 2014 and subsequently rolled it out to all Weixin users in June 2014, and we also launched direct access onTencent's Mobile QQ in August 2014.We expect our prominent level 1 access on Weixin and Mobile QQ will help us generate mobile user traffic fromTencent's large mobile user base and enhance our customers' mobile shopping experience.The two parties agree to cooperate in a number of areas including mobile-related products, social networking services, membership systems andpayment solutions.The strategic cooperation agreement has a term of five years and applies within the territory of the Greater China, including Hong Kong,Macau and Taiwan.Under the strategic cooperation agreement, we are Tencent's preferred partner for all physical goods e-commerce businesses, and Tencentagrees not to engage in any direct sales or managed marketplace business model in physical goods e-commerce businesses in Greater China and a fewselected international markets for a period of eight years, whether through a direct sales or managed marketplace business model, other than through itscontrolled affiliate Shanghai4Table of ContentsIcson E-Commerce Development Company Limited, or Shanghai Icson.We expect to further leverage the strategic partnership with Tencent to enhance ourcustomers' online shopping experience, reach Tencent's large mobile and internet user base and further expand our presence on mobile commerce.On the same date, we entered into a series of agreements with Tencent and its affiliates pursuant to which we have acquired 100% interests inTencent's Paipai and QQ Wanggou online marketplace businesses, a 9.9% stake in Shanghai Icson, logistics personnel and certain other assets.Paipai and QQWanggou, which we acquired from Tencent, are online marketplaces in China that bring buyers and sellers together online.Paipai is a consumer-to-consumeror C2C marketplace, whereas QQ Wanggou is a business-to-consumer or B2C marketplace.In July 2014, we re-launched Paipai's C2C marketplace, with theenhanced platform dedicated to providing consumers with increased selection of long-tail products.The addition of Tencent's physical goods e-commercewebsites complements our existing online marketplace business and enhances our ability to attract third-party sellers and in particular cultivate smaller third-party sellers that are more suitable for C2C selling through Paipai but may develop over time into B2C selling.In addition, we have the right to acquire theremaining equity of Shanghai Icson by March 10, 2017 at the higher of the then fair value of Shanghai Icson or RMB800 million (US$130 million).Shanghai Icson operates a B2C e-commerce platform in China.Concurrent with the above transactions, the execution of the strategic cooperation agreement and for US$214.7 million in cash to us, we issued a totalof 351,678,637 ordinary shares to Huang River Investment Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tencent, representing 15% of our total issued andoutstanding shares as of the closing of the transaction, calculated on a fully diluted basis under the treasury method.We have agreed to pay TencentRMB631 million (US$103 million) in cash during 2014 as part of the consideration for the transaction.As part of the agreements, in a private placementconcurrent with our initial public offering in May 2014, we issued an aggregate of 139,493,960 Class A ordinary shares to Huang River Investment Limitedat the per share equivalent of the price to the public, representing 5% of our total issued and outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis immediatelyfollowing the completion of our initial public offering.Huang River Investment Limited has agreed not to sell or transfer any of our shares it holds during thethree-year period commencing from March 10, 2014, subject to limited exceptions.We expect to leverage our strategic partnership with Tencent to enhance our ability to increase internet and mobile user traffic to our website, tostrengthen our direct sales and marketplace businesses on internet and mobile.Tencent has a large mobile internet user base, as evidenced by 468 millionmonthly active user accounts on Tencent's mobile applications Weixin and Wechat as of September 30, 2014 based on publicly available data.We expectour level 1 access points on Tencent's mobile applications will raise our profile among China's fast growing and large mobile internet users, many of whomfrequently use Weixin in their daily lives.We have further strengthened our team with the addition of former employees from Tencent.Finally, theacquisition of Paipai and QQ Wanggou establishes our presence in the C2C marketplace while increasing our market share in our core B2C business.Corporate History and Structure              Our founder, Mr. Richard Qiangdong Liu, launched an online retail website in January 2004.He subsequently formed a company in Beijing andanother company in Shanghai and conducted his online retail business through these two companies.In November 2006, we incorporated Star WaveInvestments Holdings Limited under the laws of the British Virgin Islands as our offshore holding company in order to facilitate international financing.Welater changed the name of this entity to 360buy Jingdong Inc.In January 2014, 360buy Jingdong Inc. was redomiciled in the Cayman Islands as an exemptedcompany registered under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and was renamed JD.com, Inc.5Table of Contents              JD.com, Inc. is a Cayman Islands holding company and we conduct our business in China through our subsidiaries and variable interest entities.Wemay rely on dividends from our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China for our cash requirements.Under PRC laws and regulations, our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China may pay dividends only out of their respective accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standardsand regulations.In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise is required to set aside at least 10% of its accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, tofund certain statutory reserve fund, until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital.See \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to OurCorporate Structure—We may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirementswe may have, and any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material and adverse effect on our ability toconduct our business.\"In April 2007, we established a wholly owned PRC subsidiary, Beijing Jingdong Century Trade Co., Ltd., or Jingdong Century, and we acquiredcertain intellectual property rights from the two companies our founder had established earlier, which ceased business operations and were later liquidatedand dissolved.Since then, Jingdong Century has established a variety of subsidiaries in China to engage in wholesale and retail sales, courier services,research and development, and internet finance.We assisted in establishing Beijing Jingdong 360 Degree E-Commerce Co., Ltd., or Jingdong 360, in April 2007.Mr. Richard Qiangdong Liu andMr.Jiaming Sun are the shareholders of Jingdong 360, with Mr. Liu owning 45% and Mr. Sun owning 55% as of the date of this prospectus.We obtainedcontrol over Jingdong 360 through Jingdong Century in April 2007 by entering into a series of

shareholders of Jiangsu Yuanzhou, with Mr. Liu owning 45% and Mr. Sun owning 55% as of the date of this prospectus.Weobtained control over Jiangsu Yuanzhou through Jingdong Century by commitments

flow, as supplemental measuresto review and assess our operating performance.The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as asubstitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.We define non-GAAP net income/(loss) as net loss excludingshare-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions.We define free cash flow as operating cashflow adding back the impact from internet financing activities and less capital expenditure, which includes purchases of property, equipment and software,cash paid for construction in progress, purchase of intangible assets, purchase of office building and purchase of land use rights.We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulatebusiness plans.Non-GAAP net income/(loss) enables our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of share-basedcompensation and amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions, which are non-cash charges.Free cash flow enables ourmanagement to assess our liquidity and cash flow while taking into account the demands that the expansion of our fulfillment infrastructure and technologyplatform has placed on our financial resources.We also believe that the use of the non-GAAP measures facilitate investors' assessment of our operatingperformance.These non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.The non-GAAP financialmeasures have limitations as analytical tools.One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income/(loss) is that it does not reflect all items of incomeand expense that affect our operations.Share-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions havebeen and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income/(loss).One of the key limitations offree cash flow is that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ fromthe non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.We compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of whichshould be considered when evaluating our performance.We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a singlefinancial measure.15Table of Contents              The following table

information in this prospectus, including the risks anduncertainties described below, before making an investment in our ADSs.Any of the following risks could have a material and adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.In any such case, the market price of our ADSs could decline, and you may lose all or part of yourinvestment.Risks Related to Our BusinessIf we are unable to manage our growth or execute our strategies effectively, our business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.Our business has grown substantially in recent years, and we expect continued growth in our business, revenues and number of employees.We plan tofurther expand our fulfillment infrastructure and technology platform, increase our product offerings and hire more employees.For example, we plan to buildlarger, custom-designed warehouses in the seven cities where we currently have fulfillment centers, and we have already finished construction in Shanghaiand have begun construction in Guangzhou and Shenyang.We also plan to establish new delivery stations in additional locations across China.In 2014, werecruited additional employees in connection with the expansion of our fulfillment infrastructure and additional research and development personnel inconnection with the expansion of our technology platform, and we will continue to invest significant resources in training, managing and motivating ourworkforce.In addition, as we increase our product offerings, we will need to work with a large number of new suppliers and third-party sellers efficiently andestablish and maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our existing and new suppliers and third-party sellers.Furthermore, as we expand into theonline consumer-to-consumer, or C2C, business following our acquisition of Paipai's C2C marketplace from Tencent, we will be dealing with potentiallymany more third-party sellers that are small businesses or individuals.To support our growth, we also plan to implement a variety of new and upgradedmanagerial, operating, financial and human resource systems, procedures and controls.We have also launched new business initiatives in internet financeand mobile virtual network operator, among others.All these efforts will require significant managerial, financial and human resources.We cannot assure youthat we will be able to effectively manage our growth or to implement all these systems, procedures and control measures successfully or that our newbusiness initiatives will be successful.If we are not able to manage our growth or execute our strategies effectively, our expansion may not be successful andour business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.We have incurred significant net losses and we may continue to experience significant losses in the future.We have incurred significant net losses since our inception.We had net losses of RMB1,284 million, RMB1,729 million, RMB50 million andRMB4,542 million (US$740 million) in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively.We had accumulated deficits ofRMB2,482 million, RMB4,213 million, RMB4,264 million and RMB8,806 million (US$1,435 million) as of December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 andSeptember 30, 2014, respectively.We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate net profits or positive cash flow from operating activities in the future.Our ability to achieveprofitability depends in large part on our ability to increase our gross margin by obtaining more favorable terms from our suppliers as our business furthergrows in scale, managing our product mix, expanding our online marketplace and our new C2C business and offering value-added services with highermargins.Accordingly, we intend to continue to invest heavily for the foreseeable future in our fulfillment infrastructure and technology platform to supportan even larger selection of products and to offer additional value-added services.As a result of the foregoing, we believe that we may incur net losses forsome time in the future.17Table of ContentsIf we are unable to provide superior customer experience, our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.The success of our business hinges on our ability to provide superior customer experience, which in turn depends on a variety of factors.These factorsinclude our ability to continue to offer authentic products at competitive prices, source products to respond to customer demands, maintain the quality of ourproducts and services, and provide timely and reliable delivery, flexible payment options and superior after-sales service.We rely primarily on our own fulfillment infrastructure, and to a lesser extent on contracted third-party couriers, to deliver our products.Interruptionsor failures in our delivery services could prevent the timely or successful delivery of our products.These interruptions may be due to unforeseen events thatare beyond our control or the control of our third-party couriers, such as inclement weather, natural disasters, transportation disruptions or labor unrest.If ourproducts are not delivered on time or are delivered in a damaged state, customers may refuse to accept our products and have less confidence in our services.Furthermore, our own delivery personnel and those of contracted third-party couriers act on our behalf and interact with our customers personally.Wemaintain cooperation arrangements with a number of third-party couriers to deliver our products to our customers in those areas not covered by our ownfulfillment infrastructure and for a portion of our bulky item deliveries, and we need to effectively manage these third-party service providers to ensure thequality of customer services.We have in the past received customer complaints from time to time regarding our delivery and return and exchange services.Any failure to provide high-quality delivery services to our customers may negatively impact the shopping experience of our customers, damage ourreputation and cause us to lose customers.Our customer service center in Suqian, Jiangsu Province provides real-time assistance to our customers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.It had3,025 customer service representatives as of September 30, 2014.Our customer service center in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, which focuses on handlingwritten questions or complaints online through instant messaging, had 2,060 customer service representatives as of the same date.We plan to increaseheadcount at our customer service centers substantially, and there is no assurance that we will be able to provide sufficient training to new employees to meetour standards of customer service or that an influx of less experienced personnel will not dilute the quality of our customer service.If our customer servicerepresentatives fail to provide satisfactory service, or if waiting times are too long due to the high volume of calls from customers at peak times, our brand andcustomer loyalty may be adversely affected.In addition, any negative publicity or poor feedback regarding our customer service may harm our brand andreputation and in turn cause us to lose customers and market share.Any harm to our JD brand or reputation may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.We believe that the recognition and reputation of our JD (  ) brand among our customers, suppliers and third-party sellers have contributedsignificantly to the growth and success of our business.Maintaining and enhancing the recognition and reputation of our brand are critical to our businessand competitiveness.Many factors, some of which are beyond our control, are important to maintaining and enhancing our brand.These factors include ourability to:•provide a compelling online shopping experience to customers; •maintain the popularity, attractiveness, diversity, quality and authenticity of the products we offer; •maintain the efficiency, reliability and quality of our fulfillment services; •maintain or improve customers' satisfaction with our after-sale services;18Table of Contents•increase brand awareness through marketing and brand promotion activities; and •preserve our reputation and goodwill in the event of any negative publicity on customer service, internet security, product quality, price orauthenticity, or other issues affecting us or other online retail businesses in China.A public perception that non-authentic, counterfeit or defective goods are sold on our website or that we or third-party service providers do notprovide satisfactory customer service, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents, could damage our reputation, diminish the value of our brand,undermine the trust and credibility we have established and have a negative impact on our ability to attract new customers or retain our current customers.Ifwe are unable to maintain our reputation, enhance our brand recognition or increase positive awareness of our website, products and services, it may bedifficult to maintain and grow our customer base, and our business and growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected.If we are unable to offer products that attract new customers and new purchases from existing customers, our business, financial condition and results ofoperations may be materially and adversely affected.Our future growth depends on our ability to continue to attract new customers as well as new purchases from existing customers.Constantly changingconsumer preferences have affected and will continue to affect the online retail industry.We must stay abreast of emerging consumer preferences andanticipate product trends that will appeal to existing and potential customers.Our website makes recommendations to customers based on their pastpurchases or on products that they viewed but did not purchase, and we also send e-mails to our customers with product recommendations tailored to theirpurchase profile.Our ability to make individually tailored recommendations is dependent on our business intelligence system, which tracks, collects andanalyzes our users' browsing and purchasing behavior, to provide accurate and reliable information.Our customers choose to purchase authentic and qualityproducts on our website due in part to the attractive prices that we offer, and they may choose to shop elsewhere if we cannot match the prices offered byother websites or by physical stores.If our customers cannot find their desired products on our website at attractive prices, they may lose interest in us andvisit our website less frequently or even stop visiting our website altogether, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operations.We plan to further expand our fulfillment infrastructure.If we are not able to manage such expansion successfully, our growth potential, business andresults of operations may be materially and adversely affected.We believe that our own nationwide fulfillment infrastructure, consisting of strategically located warehouses and delivery and pickup stations, isessential to our success.We operated fulfillment centers in 7 cities, front distribution centers in 12 cities and standalone warehouses for bulky items inanother 20 cities, as well as 2,045 delivery stations and 1,045 pickup stations in 1,855 counties and districts across China, and we employed43,133 warehouse and delivery personnel as of September 30, 2014.We are constructing larger, custom-designed warehouses to increase our storage capacityand to restructure and reorganize our fulfillment workflow and processes.We also plan to establish more delivery stations in additional counties and districtsto further enhance our ability to deliver products to customers directly ourselves.Furthermore, we hired additional employees in 2014 in connection with thestrengthening of our fulfillment capabilities.As we continue to add fulfillment and warehouse capability, our fulfillment network becomes increasinglycomplex and challenging to operate.We cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire land use rights and set up warehouses, or lease suitable facilities forthe delivery stations, on commercially acceptable terms or at all.Moreover, the order density in those smaller, less developed areas may not be sufficient toallow us to operate our own delivery network in a cost efficient manner.We may not be able to recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees inconnection with the expansion of our fulfillment infrastructure.In addition, the expansion of our fulfillment infrastructure may strain our managerial,financial, operational and other19Table of Contentsresources.If we fail to manage such expansion successfully, our growth potential, business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.Even if we manage the expansion of our fulfillment infrastructure successfully, it may not give us the competitive advantage that we expect if improvedthird-party fulfillment services become widely available at reasonable prices to retailers in China.We face intense competition.We may lose market share and customers if we fail to compete effectively.The online retail industry in China is intensely competitive.We compete for customers, orders, and third-party sellers.Our current or potentialcompetitors include major online retailers in China that offer a wide range of general merchandise product categories, major traditional retailers in China thatare moving into online retailing, major internet companies that have commenced online retail businesses, online retail companies in China focused onspecific product categories and physical retail stores, including big-box stores that also aim to offer a one-stop shopping experience.See \"Business—Competition.\"In addition, new and enhanced technologies may increase the competition in the online retail industry.New competitive business models mayappear, for example based on new forms of social media or social commerce.Increased competition may reduce our margins, market share and brand recognition, or result in significant losses.When we set prices, we have toconsider how competitors have set prices for the same or similar products.When they cut prices or offer additional benefits to compete with us, we may haveto lower our own prices or offer additional benefits or risk losing market share, either of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.Some of our current or future competitors may have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, better supplier relationships, larger customerbases or greater financial, technical or marketing resources than we do.Those smaller companies or new entrants may be acquired by, receive investment fromor enter into strategic relationships with well-established and well-financed companies or investors which would help enhance their competitive positions.Some of our competitors may be able to secure more favorable terms from suppliers, devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adoptmore aggressive pricing or inventory policies and devote substantially more resources to their website, mobile application and systems development than us.We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures may have a material andadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may encounter risks and difficulties in connection with our strategic partnership and recent acquisition of certain e-commerce businesses and assetsfrom Tencent, which may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.In March 2014, we acquired certain e-commerce businesses and assets from Tencent and entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with Tencent,and concurrently we issued 15% of our then total issued and outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis under the treasury method to a subsidiary of Tencent.The e-commerce businesses we acquired from Tencent had net losses historically and we expect to continue to incur losses from these businesses, especiallyPaipai's C2C marketplace business, in the foreseeable future.In addition, there may be unidentified issues and hidden liabilities related to the businesses andassets we acquired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.While Tencent has maderepresentations, warranties and covenants to us regarding the businesses and assets we acquired, and we are entitled to seek indemnification from Tencent forany breach of those representations, warranties and covenants, actions to seek indemnification or enforce indemnification could be costly and time-consuming and may not be successful.Moreover, our ongoing strategic partnership with Tencent may discourage us from seeking such indemnification.20Table of Contents              We expect substantial synergies between our current operations and the e-commerce businesses we acquired from Tencent.However, we mayencounter difficulties in integrating the acquired operations, services, corporate culture and personnel into our existing business and operations andimplementing the strategic cooperation agreement that we have entered into with Tencent to achieve the economic and strategic benefits that we expect.These activities may divert significant management attention from existing business operations, which may harm the effective management of our business.In addition, this acquisition would require that our management develop expertise in new areas such as Paipai's C2C marketplace and manage new businessrelationships.Furthermore, we expect to achieve growth in our mobile user base and realize other benefits in the future from the strategic cooperationagreement.Failure to generate the synergies or realize the intended benefits we anticipate from the acquisition and the strategic cooperation could materiallyand adversely affect our business and results of operations.In connection with the acquisition, we have acquired substantial intangible assets from Tencent.We have also granted restricted share units andoptions to certain employees of Tencent who joined us.As a result, we have incurred, and may continue to incur significant non-cash charges arising fromamortization of intangible assets recorded at fair value and share-based compensation, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations forthe quarterly and annual periods including and following the date of completion of the acquisition.In addition, we allocate part of our purchase price for theacquisition to goodwill.We perform a goodwill impairment test annually and evaluate intangible assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events orchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.We may incur significant impairment expenses in relation tothe intangible assets or to goodwill attributable to the acquisition from time to time in the future, which may materially and adversely affect our resultsof operations.We rely on online direct sale of computer, communication and consumer electronics for a significant portion of our net revenues.Historically, online direct sales of electronics products, including home appliances, have accounted for a majority of our total net revenues.Weexpect that sales of these products will continue to represent a significant portion of our total net revenues in the near future.We have increased our offeringsto include other product categories, such as a wide array of general merchandise product categories in 2008, cosmetics and other personal care items in 2009,food, beverage, nutritional supplements and books in 2010, music, movies and other media products in 2011, e-books and some private label products in2012, and groceries in 2013, and we have continually added new products within each product category.We expect to continue to expand our productofferings to diversify our revenue sources in the future.However, our sales of these new products and services may not increase to a level that wouldsubstantially reduce our dependence on sales of electronics products.Electronics products and home appliances sold in our online direct sales accounted for87.0%, 82.2%, 81.9% and 79.7% of our total net revenues in 2011, 2012, 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively.Electronicproducts and home appliances sold in our online direct sales and our online marketplace together accounted for 80.1%, 65.3%, 63.6% and 56.9% of our totalGMV in 2011, 2012, 2013 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, respectively.We face intense competition from online sellers of electronicsproducts and from established companies with physical stores that are moving into online retail, such as Suning Appliance Company Limited, which operatessuning.com.Any event that results in a reduction in our sales of electronics products could materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain or increaseour current level of revenue and maintain or improve our business prospects.21Table of ContentsOur expansion into new product categories and substantial increase in the number of products may expose us to new challenges and more risks.In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings to include a wide range of products including clothing, handbags, furniture, cosmetics, food,books, toys, and fitness equipment.Expansion into diverse new product categories and substantially increased number of products involves new risks andchallenges.Our lack of familiarity with these products and lack of relevant customer data relating to these products may make it more difficult for us toanticipate customer demand and preferences.We may misjudge customer demand, resulting in inventory buildup and possible inventory write-down.It mayalso make it more difficult for us to inspect and control quality and ensure proper handling, storage and delivery.We may experience higher return rates onnew products, receive more customer complaints about them and face costly product liability claims as a result of selling them, which would harm our brandand reputation as well as our financial performance.Furthermore, we may not have much purchasing power in new categories of products and we may not beable to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers.We may need to price aggressively to gain market share or remain competitive in new categories.It may bedifficult for us to achieve profitability in the new product categories and our profit margin, if any, may be lower than we anticipate, which would adverselyaffect our overall profitability and results of operations.We cannot assure you that we will be able to recoup our investments in introducing these newproduct categories.If we fail to manage our inventory effectively, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected.Our scale and business model require us to manage a large volume of inventory effectively.We depend on our demand forecasts for various kinds ofproducts to make purchase decisions and to manage our inventory.Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory isordered and the date by which we hope to sell it.Demand may be affected by seasonality, new product launches, changes in product cycles and pricing,product defects, changes in consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products and other factors, and our customers may notorder products in the quantities that we expect.In addition, when we begin selling a new product, it may be difficult to establish supplier relationships,determine appropriate product selection, and accurately forecast demand.The acquisition of certain types of inventory may require significant lead time andprepayment and they may not be returnable.For those products we sell directly, aside from books, most media products and certain other products, wenormally do not have the right to return unsold items to our suppliers.Our net inventories have increased significantly in recent periods, from RMB2,764 million as of December 31, 2011 to RMB4,754 million as ofDecember 31, 2012 and RMB6,386 million as of December 31, 2013 and further to RMB11,095 million (US$1,808 million) as of September 30, 2014.Ourinventory turnover days were 34.6 days in 2011, 35.7 days in 2012, 32.1 days in 2013 and 33.1 days in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.As weplan to continue expanding our product offerings, we expect to include more products in our inventory, which will make it more challenging for us tomanage our inventory effectively and will put more pressure on our warehousing system.If we fail to manage our inventory effectively, we may be subject to a heightened risk of inventory obsolescence, a decline in inventory values, andsignificant inventory write-downs or write-offs.In addition, we may be required to lower sale prices in order to reduce inventory level, which may lead tolower gross margins.High inventory levels may also require us to commit substantial capital resources, preventing us from using that capital for otherimportant purposes.Any of the above may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.On the other hand, if we underestimate demand for our products, or if our suppliers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we mayexperience inventory shortages, which might result22Table of Contentsin missed sales, diminished brand loyalty and lost revenues, any of which could harm our business and reputation.We may not be able to sustain our historical growth rates.We have experienced rapid growth since we commenced our online retail business in 2004.Our total net revenues increased from RMB2,919 millionin 2009 to RMB69,340 million in 2013, for a four-year CAGR of 120%, and increased by 63% from RMB49,216 million for the nine months endedSeptember 30, 2013 to RMB80,282 million (US$13,080 million) for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.However, there is no assurance that we willbe able to maintain our historical growth rates in future periods.Our revenue growth may slow or our revenues may decline for any number of possiblereasons, including decreasing consumer spending, increasing competition, slowing growth of the China retail or China online retail industry, fulfillmentbottlenecks, emergence of alternative business models, changes in government policies or general economic conditions.If our growth rate declines, investors'perceptions of our business and business prospects may be adversely affected and the market price of our ADSs could decline.If we are unable to conduct our marketing activities cost-effectively, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adverselyaffected.We have incurred significant expenses on a variety of different marketing and brand promotion efforts designed to enhance our brand recognition andincrease sales of our products.Our brand promotion and marketing activities may not be well received by customers and may not result in the levels ofproduct sales that we anticipate.We incurred RMB479 million, RMB1,097 million, RMB1,590 million and RMB2,540 million (US$414 million) ofmarketing expenses in 2011, 2012, 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively.Marketing approaches and tools in the consumerproducts market in China are evolving.This further requires us to enhance our marketing approaches and experiment with new marketing methods to keeppace with industry developments and customer preferences.Failure to refine our existing marketing approaches or to introduce new marketing approaches ina cost-effective manner could reduce our market share, cause our net revenues to decline and negatively impact our profitability.If we fail to manage and expand our relationships with suppliers, or otherwise fail to procure products at favorable terms, our business and growthprospects may suffer.We source products from third-party suppliers for our online direct sales.We had approximately 6,400 suppliers as of September 30, 2014.Oursuppliers include manufacturers, distributors and resellers.Maintaining strong relationships with these suppliers is important to the growth of our business.Inparticular, we depend significantly on our ability to procure products from suppliers on favorable pricing terms.We typically enter into one-year frameworkagreements with suppliers on an annual basis, and these framework agreements do not ensure the availability of products or the continuation of particularpricing practices or payment terms beyond the end of the contractual term.In addition, our agreements with suppliers typically do not restrict the suppliersfrom selling products to other buyers.We cannot assure you that our current suppliers will continue to sell products to us on commercially acceptable terms,or at all, after the term of the current agreement expires.Even if we maintain good relations with our suppliers, their ability to supply products to us insufficient quantity and at competitive prices may be adversely affected by economic conditions, labor actions, regulatory or legal decisions, natural disastersor other causes.In the event that we are not able to purchase merchandise at favorable prices, our revenues and cost of revenues may be materially andadversely affected.In the event any distributor or reseller does not have authority from the relevant manufacturer to sell certain products to us, suchdistributor or reseller may cease selling such products to us at any time.In addition, our accounts payable turnover days for our online direct sales23Table of Contentsbusiness excluding the impact from supply chain financing were 35.3 days in 2011, 42.1 days in 2012, 38.8 days in 2013 and 41.6 days in the nine monthsended September 30, 2014.If our suppliers cease to provide us with favorable payment terms, our requirements for working capital may increase and ouroperations may be materially and adversely affected.We will also need to establish new supplier relationships to ensure that we have access to a steadysupply of products on favorable commercial terms.If we are unable to develop and maintain good relationships with suppliers that would allow us to obtain asufficient amount and variety of authentic and quality merchandise on acceptable commercial terms, it may inhibit our ability to offer sufficient productssought by our customers, or to offer these products at competitive prices.Any adverse developments in our relationships with suppliers could materially andadversely affect our business and growth prospects.In addition, as part of our growth strategy, we plan to further expand our product offerings.If we fail toattract new suppliers to sell their products to us due to any reason, our business and growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected.Any interruption in the operation of our fulfillment centers, front distribution centers, standalone warehouses, delivery stations or pickup stations for anextended period may have an adverse impact on our business.Our ability to process and fulfill orders accurately and provide high quality customer service depends on the smooth operation of our fulfillmentcenters, front distribution centers, standalone warehouses, and our delivery and pickup stations.Our fulfillment infrastructure may be vulnerable to damagecaused by fire, flood, power outage, telecommunications failure, break-ins, earthquake, human error and other events.If any of our fulfillment centers wererendered incapable of operations, then we may be unable to fulfill any orders in any of the provinces that rely on that center.We do not carry businessinterruption insurance, and the occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial conditionand results of operations.We may not be able to recoup the investments we make to expand and upgrade our fulfillment and technology capabilities.We have invested and will continue to invest significant sums in expanding our fulfillment infrastructure and upgrading our technology platform.Inconnection with our expansion of our fulfillment infrastructure, we had paid an aggregate of approximately RMB0.8 billion (US$0.1 billion) for theacquisition of land use rights, building of warehouses and purchase of warehousing equipment as of December 31, 2013, and we paid an aggregate ofapproximately RMB0.8 billion (US$0.1 billion) for these purposes in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.We also paid significant amounts forupgrading our technology platform during the same periods.We expect to continue to invest heavily in our fulfillment and technology capabilities for anumber of years.We also intend to continue to add personnel and other resources to our fulfillment infrastructure and technology platform as we focus onexpanding our product selection and offering new services.We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of theanticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect.We may not be able to recover ourcapital expenditures or investments, in part or in full, or the recovery of these capital expenditures or investments may take longer than expected.As a result,the carrying value of the related assets may be subject to an impairment charge, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.Moreover, our heavy investment in building our own fulfillment infrastructure may put us at a competitive disadvantage against those competitorswho primarily rely on third-party fulfillment services and focus their investment on improving other aspects of their business.We have designed our ownfulfillment infrastructure to satisfy our business and operation requirements and to accommodate our fast growth, but there is no guarantee that we will besuccessful in meeting our objectives or that our own fulfillment structure will function more effectively and efficiently than third-party solutions.24Table of ContentsWe use third-party couriers to deliver some orders, and our third-party sellers use couriers to deliver a significant number of orders.If these couriers fail toprovide reliable delivery services, our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.We maintain cooperation arrangements with a number of third-party couriers to deliver our products to our customers in those areas not covered byour own fulfillment infrastructure, particularly in smaller and less developed areas.We may also use third-party service providers to ship products from ourfulfillment centers or front distribution centers to delivery stations or to deliver bulky item products.Third-party sellers also use third-party couriers if theydo not make use of our delivery services.Interruptions to or failures in these third parties' delivery services could prevent the timely or proper delivery of ourproducts to customers.These interruptions may be due to events that are beyond our control or the control of these delivery companies, such as inclementweather, natural disasters, transportation disruptions or labor unrest.In addition, if our third-party couriers fail to comply with applicable rules andregulations in China, our delivery services may be materially and adversely affected.We may not be able to find alternative delivery companies to providedelivery services in a timely and reliable manner, or at all.Delivery of our products could also be affected or interrupted by the merger, acquisition,insolvency or government shut-down of the delivery companies we engage to make deliveries, especially those local companies with relatively smallbusiness scales.If our products are not delivered in proper condition or on a timely basis, our business and reputation could suffer.Our online marketplace is subject to risks associated with third-party sellers.We launched our online marketplace in October 2010, and re-launched Paipai's C2C marketplace in July 2014 following our acquisition of thebusiness from Tencent in March 2014.As of September 30, 2014, there were over 50,000 third-party sellers on our online marketplace.We do not have asmuch control over the storage and delivery of products sold on our online marketplace as we do over the products that we sell directly ourselves.Many of ourthird-party sellers use their own facilities to store their products, and many of them use their own or third-party delivery systems to deliver their products toour customers, which makes it more difficult for us to ensure that our customers get the same high quality service for all products sold on our website.If anythird-party seller does not control the quality of the products that it sells on our website, or if it does not deliver the products or delivers them late or deliversproducts that are materially different from its description of them, or if it sells counterfeit or unlicensed products on our website, or if it sells certain productswithout licenses or permits as required by the relevant laws and regulations even though we have requested such licenses or permits in our standard formcontract with the third-party seller, the reputation of our online marketplace and our JD brand may be materially and adversely affected and we could faceclaims that we should be held liable for any losses.Moreover, despite our efforts to prevent it, some products sold on our online marketplace may competewith the products we sell directly, which may cannibalize our online direct sales.In addition, the supplier relationships, customer acquisition dynamics andother requirements for our online marketplace may not be the same as those for our online direct sales operations, which may complicate the management ofour business.In order for our online marketplace to be successful, we must continue to identify and attract third-party sellers, and we may not be successful inthis regard.Uncertainties relating to the growth and profitability of the retail industry in China in general, and the online retail industry in particular, could adverselyaffect our revenues and business prospects.We generate substantially all of our revenues from online retail.While online retail has existed in China since the 1990s, only recently have certainlarge online retail companies become profitable.The long-term viability and prospects of various online retail business models in China remain relatively25Table of Contentsuntested.Our future results of operations will depend on numerous factors affecting the development of the online retail industry in China, which may bebeyond our control.These factors include:•the growth of internet, broadband, personal computer and mobile penetration and usage in China, and the rate of any such growth; •the trust and confidence level of online retail consumers in China, as well as changes in customer demographics and consumer tastes andpreferences; •the selection, price and popularity of products that we and our competitors offer online; •whether alternative retail channels or business models that better address the needs of consumers emerge in China; and •the development of fulfillment, payment and other ancillary services associated with online purchases.A decline in the popularity of online shopping in general, or any failure by us to adapt our website and improve the online shopping experience ofour customers in response to trends and consumer requirements, may adversely affect our net revenues and business prospects.Furthermore, the retail industry is very sensitive to macroeconomic changes, and retail purchases tend to decline during recessionary periods.Substantially all of our net revenues are derived from retail sales in China.Many factors outside of our control, including inflation and deflation, volatility ofstock and property markets, interest rates, tax rates and other government policies and unemployment rates can adversely affect consumer confidence andspending, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our growth and profitability.Unfavorable developments in domestic and international politics,including military conflicts, political turmoil and social instability, may also adversely affect consumer confidence and reduce spending, which could in turnmaterially and adversely affect our growth and profitability.In connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2013, we and our independent registeredpublic accounting firm identified one material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.If we fail to develop and maintain an effectivesystem of internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.In connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, we and our independentregistered public accounting firm identified one material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.As defined in the standards established bythe U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a \"material weakness\" is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control overfinancial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be preventedor detected on a timely basis.The material weakness that has been identified relates to our lack of sufficient financial reporting and accounting personnel with appropriateknowledge of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements to properly address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and to prepare and review ourconsolidated financial statements and related disclosures to fulfill U.S. GAAP and SEC financial reporting requirements.The material weakness, if not timelyremedied, may lead to significant misstatements in our consolidated financial statements in the future.Neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm undertook a comprehensive assessment of our internal control for purposes ofidentifying and reporting material weaknesses and other control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting.Had we performed a formalassessment of our internal control over financial reporting or had our independent registered public26Table of Contentsaccounting firm performed an audit of our internal control over financial reporting, additional deficiencies may have been identified.Following the identification of the material weakness and other control deficiencies, we have taken measures and plan to continue to take measures toremedy these control deficiencies.See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Internal Control overFinancial Reporting.\"However, the implementation of these measures may not fully address these deficiencies in our internal control over financialreporting, and we cannot conclude that they have been fully remedied.Our failure to correct these control deficiencies or our failure to discover and addressany other control deficiencies could result in inaccuracies in our financial statements and impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reportingrequirements and related regulatory filings on a timely basis.Moreover, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could significantly hinder ourability to prevent fraud.Since our initial public offering, we have become subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that weinclude a report from management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on Form 20-F beginning with ourannual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015.In addition, beginning at the same time, our independent registered public accounting firm mustreport on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.If we fail to remedy the problems identified above, our management and ourindependent registered public accounting firm may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective.This conclusion couldadversely impact the market price of our ADSs due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our reporting processes.We also expect to incursignificant costs and expenses associated with our becoming a public company, including costs to prepare for our first Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002Section 404 compliance testing and additional legal and accounting costs to comply with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, asamended, or the Exchange Act, that will apply to us as a public company.If our senior management is unable to work together effectively or efficiently or if we lose their services, our business may be severely disrupted.Our success heavily depends upon the continued services of our management.In particular, we rely on the expertise and experience of Mr. RichardQiangdong Liu, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer, and other executive officers.The majority of our senior management joined us in the pastthree years.If they cannot work together effectively or efficiently, our business may be severely disrupted.If one or more of our senior management wereunable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we might not be able to replace them easily or at all, and our business, financial condition andresults of operations may be materially and adversely affected.If any of our senior management joins a competitor or forms a competing business, we maylose customers, suppliers, know-how and key professionals and staff members.Our senior management has entered into employment agreements andconfidentiality and non-competition agreements with us.However, if any dispute arises between our officers and us, we may have to incur substantial costsand expenses in order to enforce such agreements in China or we may be unable to enforce them at all.If we are unable to recruit, train and retain qualified personnel or sufficient workforce while controlling our labor costs, our business may be materiallyand adversely affected.We intend to hire additional qualified employees to support our business operations and planned expansion.Our future success depends, to asignificant extent, on our ability to recruit, train and retain qualified personnel, particularly technical, fulfillment, marketing and other operational personnelwith experience in the online retail industry.Our experienced mid-level managers are instrumental in implementing our business strategies, executing ourbusiness plans and supporting our business operations and growth.The effective operation of our managerial and operating systems,27Table of Contentsfulfillment infrastructure, customer service center and other back office functions also depends on the hard work and quality performance of our managementand employees.Since our industry is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent and labor, we can provide no assurance that we will beable to attract or retain qualified staff or other highly skilled employees that we will need to achieve our strategic objectives.Our fulfillment infrastructure islabor intensive and requires a substantial number of blue-collar workers, and these positions tend to have higher than average turnover.As of September 30,2014, we employed a total of 43,133 warehouse and delivery personnel.During the rest of 2014, we may hire additional employees in connection with thestrengthening of our fulfillment capabilities and research and development personnel in connection with the expansion of our technology platform.We haveobserved an overall tightening of the labor market and an emerging trend of shortage of labor supply.Failure to obtain stable and dedicated warehousing,delivery and other labor support may lead to underperformance of these functions and cause disruption to our business.Labor costs in China have increasedwith China's economic development, particularly in the large cities where we operate our fulfillment centers and more generally in the urban areas where wemaintain our delivery and pickup stations.Because we operate our own fulfillment infrastructure, which requires a large and rapidly growing work force, ourcost structure is more vulnerable to labor costs than that of many of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage.In addition, our abilityto train and integrate new employees into our operations may also be limited and may not meet the demand for our business growth on a timely fashion, or atall, and rapid expansion may impair our ability to maintain our corporate culture.We may incur liability or become subject to administrative penalties for counterfeit or unauthorized products sold on our website, or for products sold onour website or content posted on our website that infringe on third-party intellectual property rights, or for other misconduct.We sourced our products from approximately 6,400 suppliers as of September 30, 2014.Third-party sellers on our online marketplace are separatelyresponsible for sourcing the products they sell on our website.As of September 30, 2014, we had over 50,000 third-party sellers on our online marketplace.Although we have adopted measures to verify the authenticity and authorization of products sold on our website and avoid potential infringement of third-party intellectual property rights in the course of sourcing and selling products, we may not always be successful.In the event that counterfeit, unauthorized or infringing products are sold on our website or infringing content is posted on our website, we could faceclaims that we should be held liable.We have in the past received claims alleging our infringement of third parties' rights.Irrespective of the validity of suchclaims, we could incur significant costs and efforts in either defending against or settling such claims.If there is a successful claim against us, we might berequired to pay substantial damages or refrain from further sale of the relevant products.Potential liability under PRC law if we negligently participated orassisted in infringement activities associated with counterfeit goods includes injunctions to cease infringing activities, rectification, compensation,administrative penalties and even criminal liability.Moreover, such third-party claims or administrative penalties could result in negative publicity and ourreputation could be severely damaged.Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financialcondition.Under our standard form agreements, we require suppliers or third-party sellers to indemnify us for any losses we suffer or any costs that we incur dueto any products we source from these suppliers or any products sold by these third-party sellers.However, not all of our agreements with suppliers and third-party sellers have such terms, and for those agreements that have such terms, we may not be able to successfully enforce our contractual rights and may needto initiate costly and lengthy legal proceedings in China to protect our rights.See \"—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—We may be adverselyaffected by the complexity, uncertainties and changes in PRC regulation of internet-related business and companies.\"28Table of ContentsWe may be subject to product liability claims if people or properties are harmed by the products we sell.We sell products manufactured by third parties, some of which may be defectively designed or manufactured.As a result, sales of such products couldexpose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions.Third parties subject tosuch injury or damage may bring claims or legal proceedings against us as the retailer of the product.Although we would have legal recourse against themanufacturer of such products under PRC law, attempting to enforce our rights against the manufacturer may be expensive, time-consuming and ultimatelyfutile.In addition, we do not currently maintain any third-party liability insurance or product liability insurance in relation to products we sell.As a result,any material product liability claim or litigation could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Evenunsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and managerial efforts in defending them and could have a negative impact on our reputation.The proper functioning of our technology platform is essential to our business.Any failure to maintain the satisfactory performance of our website andsystems could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation.The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our technology platform are critical to our success and our ability to attract and retaincustomers and provide quality customer service.All of our sales of products are made online through our website and mobile applications, and the fulfillmentservices we provide to third-party sellers are related to sales of their products through our website and mobile applications.Any system interruptions causedby telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hacking or other attempts to harm our systems that result in the unavailability or slowdown of our websiteor reduced order fulfillment performance could reduce the volume of products sold and the attractiveness of product offerings on our website.Our servers mayalso be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, which could lead to system interruptions, website slowdownor unavailability, delays or errors in transaction processing, loss of data or the inability to accept and fulfill customer orders.Security breaches, computerviruses and hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry.Because of our brand recognition in the online retail industry in China, we believewe are a particularly attractive target for such attacks.We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, such attacks and unexpectedinterruptions.We can provide no assurance that our current security mechanisms will be sufficient to protect our IT systems from any third-party intrusions,viruses or hacker attacks, information or data theft or other similar activities.Any such future occurrences could reduce customer satisfaction, damage ourreputation and result in a material decrease in our revenue.Additionally, we must continue to upgrade and improve our technology platform to support our business growth, and failure to do so could impedeour growth.However, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in executing these system upgrades and improvement strategies.In particular, oursystems may experience interruptions during upgrades, and the new technologies or infrastructures may not be fully integrated with the existing systems on atimely basis, or at all.In addition, we experience surges in online traffic and orders associated with promotional activities and holiday seasons, such asJune 18 and November 11, which can put additional demands on our technology platform at specific times.If our existing or future technology platform doesnot function properly, it could cause system disruptions and slow response times, affecting data transmission, which in turn could materially and adverselyaffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Any deficiencies in China's internet infrastructure could impair our ability to sell products over our website and mobile applications, which could cause usto lose customers and harm our operating results.All of our sales of products are made online through our website and mobile applications, and the fulfillment services we provide to third-party sellersare related to sales of their products through29Table of Contentsour website and mobile applications.Our business depends on the performance and reliability of the internet infrastructure in China.The availability of ourwebsite depends on telecommunications carriers and other third-party providers for communications and storage capacity, including bandwidth and serverstorage, among other things.If we are unable to enter into and renew agreements with these providers on acceptable terms, or if any of our existingagreements with such providers are terminated as a result of our breach or otherwise, our ability to provide our services to our customers could be adverselyaffected.Almost all access to the internet in China is maintained through state-owned telecommunication carriers under administrative control, and we obtainaccess to end-user networks operated by such telecommunications carriers and internet service providers to give customers access to our website.We haveexperienced service interruptions in the past, which were typically caused by service interruptions at the underlying external telecommunications serviceproviders, such as the internet data centers and broadband carriers from which we lease services.Service interruptions prevent consumers from accessing ourwebsite and mobile applications and placing orders, and frequent interruptions could frustrate customers and discourage them from attempting to placeorders, which could cause us to lose customers and harm our operating results.If we fail to adopt new technologies or adapt our website, mobile applications and systems to changing customer requirements or emerging industrystandards, our business may be materially and adversely affected.To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and features of our website and mobileapplications.The internet and the online retail industry are characterized by rapid technological evolution, changes in customer requirements andpreferences, frequent introductions of new products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices,any of which could render our existing technologies and systems obsolete.Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to identify, develop, acquire orlicense leading technologies useful in our business, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices, such as mobileinternet, in a cost-effective and timely way.The development of websites, mobile applications and other proprietary technology entails significant technicaland business risks.We cannot assure you that we will be able to use new technologies effectively or adapt our website, mobile applications, proprietarytechnologies and systems to meet customer requirements or emerging industry standards.If we are unable to adapt in a cost-effective and timely manner inresponse to changing market conditions or customer requirements, whether for technical, legal, financial or other reasons, our business, prospects, financialcondition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.Customer growth and activity on mobile devices depends upon effective use of mobile operating systems, networks and standards that we do not control.Purchases using mobile devices by consumers generally, and by our customers specifically, have increased significantly, and we expect this trend tocontinue.To optimize the mobile shopping experience, we are somewhat dependent on our customers downloading our specific mobile applications for theirparticular devices as opposed to accessing our sites from an internet browser on their mobile device.As new mobile devices and platforms are released, it isdifficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing applications for these alternative devices and platforms, and we may need to devotesignificant resources to the development, support and maintenance of such applications.In addition, our future growth and our results of operations couldsuffer if we experience difficulties in the future in integrating our mobile applications into mobile devices or if problems arise with our relationships withproviders of mobile operating systems or mobile application download stores, if our applications receive unfavorable treatment compared to competingapplications on the download stores, or if we face increased costs to distribute or have customers use our mobile applications.We are further dependent onthe interoperability of our sites with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control, such as iOS and Android, and any changes in such systems thatdegrade the functionality30Table of Contentsof our sites or give preferential treatment to competitive products could adversely affect the usage of our sites on mobile devices.In the event that it is moredifficult for our customers to access and use our sites on their mobile devices, or if our customers choose not to access or to use our sites on their mobiledevices or to use mobile products that do not offer access to our sites, our customer growth could be harmed and our business, financial condition andoperating results may be adversely affected.Failure to protect confidential information of our customers and network against security breaches could damage our reputation and brand andsubstantially harm our business and results of operations.A significant challenge to the online retail industry is the secure storage of confidential information and its secure transmission over public networks.All of the orders and some of the payments for products we offer are made through our website and our mobile applications.In addition, some onlinepayments for our products are settled through third-party online payment services.We also share certain personal information about our customers withcontracted third-party couriers, such as their names, addresses, phone numbers and transaction records.Maintaining complete security for the storage andtransmission of confidential information on our technology platform, such as customer names, personal information and billing addresses, is essential tomaintaining customer confidence.We have adopted security policies and measures, including encryption technology, to protect our proprietary data and customer information.However, advances in technology, the expertise of hackers, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in acompromise or breach of the technology that we use to protect confidential information.We may not be able to prevent third parties, especially hackers orother individuals or entities engaging in similar activities, from illegally obtaining such confidential or private information we hold as a result of ourcustomers' visits to our website and use of our mobile applications.Such individuals or entities obtaining our customers' confidential or private informationmay further engage in various other illegal activities using such information.In addition, we have limited control or influence over the security policies ormeasures adopted by third-party providers of online payment services through which some of our customers may elect to make payment for purchases.Thecontracted third-party couriers we use may also violate their confidentiality obligations and disclose or use information about our customers illegally.Anynegative publicity on our website's or mobile applications' safety or privacy protection mechanisms and policies, and any claims asserted against us or finesimposed upon us as a result of actual or perceived failures, could have a material and adverse effect on our public image, reputation, financial condition andresults of operations.We have experienced breaches of our information security measures in the past due to external causes beyond our control, such as a leakof user account information from the China Software Developer Network (CSDN) in 2011, although none of the past breaches individually or in the aggregatewas material to our business or operations.We cannot assure you that similar events will not occur in the future.If we give third parties greater access to ourtechnology platform in the future as part of providing more technology services to third-party sellers and others, it may become more challenging for us toensure the security of our systems.Any compromise of our information security or the information security measures of our contracted third-party couriers orthird-party online payment service providers could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, prospects, financial condition and resultsof operations.Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet andmobile platforms have recently come under increased public scrutiny.As online retail continues to evolve, we believe that increased regulation by the PRCgovernment of data privacy on the internet is likely.We may become subject to new laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processingor use of personal or consumer information that could affect how we store, process and share data with our customers, suppliers and third-party sellers.Wegenerally comply with industry standards and are subject to the terms of our own privacy policies.Compliance with any additional laws could be expensive,and may place restrictions on31Table of Contentsthe conduct of our business and the manner in which we interact with our customers.Any failure to comply with applicable regulations could also result inregulatory enforcement actions against us.Significant capital and other resources may be required to protect against information security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by suchbreaches or to comply with our privacy policies or privacy-related legal obligations.The resources required may increase over time as the methods used byhackers and others engaged in online criminal activities are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving.Any failure or perceived failure by us toprevent information security breaches or to comply with privacy policies or privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results inthe unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other customer data, could cause our customers to lose trust in us and couldexpose us to legal claims.Any perception by the public that online transactions or the privacy of user information are becoming increasingly unsafe orvulnerable to attacks could inhibit the growth of online retail and other online services generally, which may reduce the number of orders we receive.The wide variety of payment methods that we accept subjects us to third-party payment processing-related risks.We accept payments using a variety of methods, including payment on delivery, bank transfers, online payments with credit cards and debit cardsissued by major banks in China, and payment through third-party online payment platforms such as 99Bill, CMPay and UnionPay.For certain paymentmethods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower our profitmargins.We may also be subject to fraud and other illegal activities in connection with the various payment methods we offer, including online payment andcash on delivery options.We also rely on third parties to provide payment processing services.Although we deliver a majority of the orders directly tocustomers ourselves, we use contracted third-party couriers to service areas that are not directly covered by our delivery network.Given that customers placetheir orders online but often choose the cash-on-delivery option, the delivery personnel of our contracted third-party couriers collect payments on our behalf,and we require the contracted third-party couriers to remit the payment collected to us on the following day.If these companies fail to remit the paymentcollected to us in a timely fashion or at all, if they become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us, or if their service quality deteriorates, ourbusiness could be disrupted.We are also subject to various rules, regulations and requirements, regulatory or otherwise, governing electronic funds transfers,which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply.If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may besubject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfersor facilitate other types of online payments, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Our delivery, return and exchange policies may adversely affect our results of operations.We have adopted shipping policies that do not necessarily pass the full cost of shipping on to our customers.We also have adopted customer-friendlyreturn and exchange policies that make it convenient and easy for customers to change their minds after completing purchases.We may also be required bylaw to adopt new or amend existing return and exchange policies from time to time.For example, pursuant to the recently amended Consumer ProtectionLaw, which became effective in March 2014, consumers are generally entitled to return the products purchased within seven days upon receipt withoutgiving any reasons when they purchase the products from business operators on the internet.See \"—Regulations Relating to Product Quality and ConsumerProtection.\"These policies improve customers' shopping experience and promote customer loyalty, which in turn help us acquire and retain customers.However, these policies also subject us to additional costs and expenses which we32Table of Contentsmay not recoup through increased revenue.Our ability to handle a large volume of returns is unproven.If our return and exchange policy is misused by asignificant number of customers, our costs may increase significantly and our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.If we revise thesepolicies to reduce our costs and expenses, our customers may be dissatisfied, which may result in loss of existing customers or failure to acquire newcustomers at a desirable pace, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations.We have limited experience in operating an internet finance business.Significant deterioration in the asset quality of our internet finance business mayhave an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have recently started to participate in the emerging internet finance sector in China.We have developed various financial products, includingsupply chain financing as an additional value-added service we provide to our suppliers and third-party sellers on our online marketplace, and consumerfinancing.Expansion in this new business area involves new risks and challenges.For certain financial products, we have committed or will commit our owncapital.Our lack of familiarity with the internet finance sector may make it difficult for us to anticipate the demands and preferences in the market anddevelop financial products that meet the requirements and preference.We may not be able to successfully identify new product and service opportunities ordevelop and introduce these opportunities to our clients in a timely and cost-effective manner, or our clients may be disappointed in the returns fromfinancial products that we offer.Furthermore, our ability to manage the quality of our loan portfolio will have significant impact on the results of operationsof our internet finance business.Deterioration in the overall quality of our loan portfolio may occur due to a variety of reasons, including factors beyond ourcontrol, such as a slowdown in the growth of the PRC or global economies or a liquidity or credit crisis in the PRC or global finance sectors, which mayadversely affect the businesses, operations or liquidity of our suppliers, third-party sellers and customers or their ability to repay or roll over their debt.Anysignificant deterioration in the asset quality of our internet finance business may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financialcondition.Our use of some leased properties could be challenged by third parties or government authorities, which may cause interruptions to our businessoperations.Approximately 19% of the lessors of our leased warehouses, approximately 6% of the lessors of our leased offices, and approximately 14% of thelessors of our leased delivery stations and pickup stations have not provided us with their property ownership certificates or any other documentationproving their right to lease those properties to us.If our lessors are not the owners of the properties and they have not obtained consents from the owners ortheir lessors or permits from the relevant government authorities, our leases could be invalidated.If this occurs, we may have to renegotiate the leases with theowners or the parties who have the right to lease the properties, and the terms of the new leases may be less favorable to us.Some of the leased properties werealso subject to mortgage at the time the leases were entered into.If no consent had been obtained from the mortgage holder under such circumstances, thelease may not be binding on the transferee of the property in the event that the mortgage holder forecloses on the mortgage and transfers the property toanother party.In addition, a substantial portion of our leasehold interests in leased properties have not been registered with the relevant PRC governmentauthorities as required by PRC law, which may expose us to potential fines.As of the date of this prospectus, we are not aware of any claims or actions being contemplated or initiated by government authorities, propertyowners or any other third parties with respect to our leasehold interests in or use of such properties.However, we cannot assure you that our use of such leasedproperties will not be challenged.In the event that our use of properties is33Table of Contentssuccessfully challenged, we may be subject to fines and forced to relocate the affected operations.In addition, we may become involved in disputes with theproperty owners or third parties who otherwise have rights to or interests in our leased properties.We can provide no assurance that we will be able to findsuitable replacement sites on terms acceptable to us on a timely basis, or at all, or that we will not be subject to material liability resulting from third parties'challenges on our use of such properties.As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.Failure to renew our current leases or locate desirable alternatives for our facilities could materially and adversely affect our business.We lease properties for our offices, customer service center, warehouses, sorting centers, and delivery and pickup stations.We may not be able tosuccessfully extend or renew such leases upon expiration of the current term on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and may therefore be forced torelocate our affected operations.This could disrupt our operations and result in significant relocation expenses, which could adversely affect our business,financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we compete with other businesses for premises at certain locations or of desirable sizes.As a result,even though we could extend or renew our leases, rental payments may significantly increase as a result of the high demand for the leased properties.Inaddition, we may not be able to locate desirable alternative sites for our facilities as our business continues to grow and failure in relocating our affectedoperations could adversely affect our business and operations.Any lack of requisite approvals, licenses or permits applicable to our business may have a material and adverse impact on our business, financialcondition and results of operations.Our business is subject to governmental supervision and regulation by the relevant PRC governmental authorities, including but not limited to theMinistry of Commerce, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or MIIT, the Ministry of Transport, the State Post Bureau and the People's Bankof China.Together, these government authorities promulgate and enforce regulations that cover many aspects of the operation of the online retail, courier,road freight transportation and internet finance industries, including entry into these industries, the scope of permissible business activities, licenses andpermits for various business activities, and foreign investment.See \"Regulation—Regulations Relating to Foreign Investment\" and \"Regulation—Licensesand Permits\".Under PRC law, an entity operating courier services across multiple provinces must obtain a cross-provincial Courier Service Operation Permit andconduct its courier services within the permitted scope as indicated in the permit.Furthermore, any entity engaging in road freight transportation services inChina must obtain a Road Transportation Operation Permit from the relevant road transportation administrative authorities.We operate a nationwide roadfreight transportation and delivery network.As of the date of this prospectus, we have obtained two cross-provincial Courier Service Operation Permits thatallow Jiangsu Jingdong and Jingbangda, two of our PRC subsidiaries providing logistics services, to operate an express delivery business in 30 provincesand 45 cities in China.As of September 30, 2014, Jiangsu Jingdong and its 31 branches, Jingbangda and its 35 branches have obtained Courier ServiceOperation Permits.As of the same date, Jiangsu Jingdong and its 24 branches, Jingbangda and its 3 branches have obtained Road Transportation OperationPermits that allow these entities to provide road freight transportation services.We are in the process of applying for extension of the coverage of our CourierService Operation Permits to other areas of China and for additional Road Transportation Operation Permits for Jiangsu Jingdong's other branches, andJingbangda's branches from the appropriate level of government authorities and obtaining necessary licenses for all of our vehicles used for transportinggoods.However, we cannot assure you that we can obtain such permits and licenses in a timely manner, or at all, due to complex procedural requirements andpolicies.34Table of Contents              In addition, the online services and payment services provided by Jingdong 360, one of our consolidated variable interest entities, for our PRCsubsidiaries and third-party sellers on our website may be considered as online data processing and transaction processing services and subject to licensefrom the MIIT.We are in the process of applying for additional expansion of the scope of Jingdong 360's value-added telecommunication license to coveronline data processing and transaction processing services.However, we cannot assure you that we can obtain the approval to expand the scope of suchlicense in a timely manner, or at all.Also we issue one type of prepaid cards which can be used to buy most of the products sold on our website, includingthose sold by third-party sellers on our online marketplace.These cards may be deemed to be multiple-purpose commercial pre-paid cards and if so, a licensefrom the relevant authority is required.An indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Jingdong 360 has applied to the relevant government authority for theexpansion of the business types covered by its Payment Service License to cover issuance and acceptance of pre-paid cards, and the application has beenpublicized by the relevant government authority on its official website.However, we cannot assure you that we can obtain the approval to expand thebusiness types of the license in a timely manner, or at all.Furthermore, we work with some lottery issuers and lottery sales agents to sell lottery tickets on our website, through which we provide the onlineselling platform service to the lottery issuers and lottery sales agents.Under PRC law, any lottery issuer wishing to launch online lottery sales, after obtainingthe approval from the relevant authority, is required to submit the application as well as the information on the internet service provider for online lotterysales to the Ministry of Finance for its examination and approval.As of the date of this prospectus, it is unclear to us whether our lottery business partnershave obtained such approval from the Ministry of Finance for their online lottery business.There may be some defects with respect to the process of establishing certain of our indirect subsidiaries in China.Certain subsidiaries of our whollyforeign-owned subsidiaries in China were established without obtaining the prior approval from the relevant government authorities that supervise therelevant industries, and some obtain the relevant permits from the government authority at a level lower than as required.We have not received any notice ofwarning or been subject to penalties or other disciplinary action from the relevant governmental authorities with respect to these defects.However, we cannotassure you that the relevant governmental authorities would not require us to obtain the approvals, or the permits from proper level of government authoritiesto cure the defects, or take any other actions retrospectively in the future.If the relevant government authorities require us to cure such defects, we cannotassure you that we will be able to obtain the approvals, or the permits from proper level of government authorities, in a timely manner or at all.If the PRC government considers that we were operating without the proper approvals, licenses or permits, it has the power, among other things, tolevy fines, confiscate our income, revoke our business licenses, and require us to discontinue our relevant business or impose restrictions on the affectedportion of our business.Any of these actions by the PRC government may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.The e-commerce industry, and online retail in particular, is highly regulated by the PRC government.We are required to obtain various licenses andpermits from different regulatory authorities in order to distribute certain categories of products on our website.See \"Regulation—Licenses and Permits.\"Wehave made great efforts to obtain all the applicable licenses and permits, but due to the large number of products sold on our website, we may not always beable to do so and we were penalized by governmental authorities for selling products without proper licenses.As we increase our product selection, we mayalso become subject to new or existing laws and regulations that did not affect us before.35Table of Contents              As online retail and internet finance are evolving rapidly in China, new laws and regulations may be adopted from time to time to require additionallicenses and permits other than those we currently have, and to address new issues that arise from time to time.As a result, substantial uncertainties existregarding the interpretation and implementation of PRC laws and regulations applicable to online retail businesses and internet finance businesses.If we areunable to maintain and renew one or more of our licenses and certificates when their current term expires, or obtain such renewals on commerciallyreasonable terms, our operations could be disrupted.For example, in September 2013, the Ministry of Commerce issued draft administrative measuresregulating the trading rules of third-party online marketplace platforms for public comment.If the draft administrative measures are adopted into law in thefuture, we may need to adjust the transaction rules for our online marketplace platform.In addition, in December 2013, as reported by several media outlets,the General Office of the State Council issued a notice to strengthen the supervision on \"phantom banks\", including new-style internet finance companies,non-financial wealth management companies, financing guarantee companies and microcredit companies, so as to promote the development and innovationof the financial markets as well as to prevent financial crises.Accordingly, if the PRC government requires additional licenses or permits or provides morestrict supervision requirements in the future in order for us to conduct our businesses, there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such licenses orpermits or meet all the supervision requirements in a timely manner, or at all.We have granted, and may continue to grant, restricted share units and other types of awards under our share incentive plans, which may result inincreased share-based compensation expenses.We adopted a stock issuance plan in June 2008, an employee stock incentive plan in February 2009, an employee stock incentive plan in March2010, an employee stock incentive plan in April 2011 and a special employee stock incentive plan in April 2011.We refer to these five plans collectively asthe Original Plans.On December 20, 2013, we adopted our 2013 Share Incentive Plan, or the 2013 Plan, to replace all of the Original Plans, and amended andrestated the 2013 Plan in March 2014 increasing the number of shares reserved for future awards under the 2013 Plan.The 2013 Plan was recently replaced bya share incentive plan entitled \"Share Incentive Plan\" containing substantially the same terms as the 2013 Plan.See \"Management—Share Incentive Plan\" fora detailed discussion.For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we recorded RMB71 million,RMB225 million, RMB261 million and RMB4,078 million (US$664 million), respectively, in share-based compensation expenses.In the first quarter of2014, we granted 93,780,970 immediately vesting restricted share units to our chairman and chief executive officer, Mr. Richard Qiangdong Liu, and weincurred share-based compensation expenses in connection with Mr. Liu in an estimated amount of US$591 million in the quarter.In the same quarter, wegranted additional 12,296,594 restricted share units and options to purchase an aggregate of 1,955,000 ordinary shares to former Tencent employees who hadjoined or would join us after our transactions with Tencent, and certain of our existing employees and consultants, and we incurred additional share-basedcompensation expenses in connection with these grants.In addition, we granted 147,702 and 2,950,220 restricted share units in May 2014 and July 2014,respectively, to our employees and certain consultants.We believe the granting of share-based compensation is of significant importance to our ability toattract and retain key personnel and employees, and we will continue to grant share-based compensation to employees in the future.As a result, our expensesassociated with share-based compensation may increase, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our results of operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations.We experience seasonality in our business, reflecting a combination of traditional retail seasonality patterns and new patterns associated with onlineretail in particular.For example, we generally experience less user traffic and purchase orders during national holidays in China, particularly during theChinese New Year holiday season in the first quarter of each year.Furthermore, sales in the36Table of Contentstraditional retail industry are significantly higher in the fourth quarter of each calendar year than in the preceding three quarters.E-commerce companies inChina hold special promotional campaigns on November 11 each year, and we hold a special promotional campaign in the second quarter of each year, onJune 18, to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of our business, both of which can affect our results for those quarters.Overall, the historical seasonalityof our business has been relatively mild due to the rapid growth we have experienced and may increase further in the future.Our financial condition andresults of operations for future periods may continue to fluctuate.As a result, the trading price of our ADSs may fluctuate from time to time due to seasonality.Future strategic alliances, investments or acquisitions may have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.We may in the future enter into strategic alliances with various third parties to further our business purposes from time to time.Strategic alliances withthird parties could subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information, non-performance by the counterparty, andan increase in expenses incurred in establishing new strategic alliances, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business.We may have littleability to control or monitor their actions.To the extent the third parties suffer negative publicity or harm to their reputations from events relating to theirbusiness, we may also suffer negative publicity or harm to our reputation by virtue of our association with such third parties.In addition, if we are presented with appropriate opportunities, we may invest in or acquire additional assets, technologies or businesses that arecomplementary to our existing business.Future investments or acquisitions and the subsequent integration of new assets and businesses into our own wouldrequire significant attention from our management and could result in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could have anadverse effect on our business operations.The costs of identifying and consummating investments and acquisitions may be significant.We may also incursignificant expenses in obtaining necessary approvals from relevant government authorities in China and elsewhere in the world.Acquired assets orbusinesses may not generate the financial results we expect.In addition, investments and acquisitions could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash,potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the occurrence of significant goodwill impairment charges, amortization expenses for other intangibleassets and exposure to potential unknown liabilities of the acquired business.The cost and duration of integrating newly acquired businesses could alsomaterially exceed our expectations.Any such negative developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.We may need additional capital, and financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needsfor the next 12 months.We may, however, require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including anychanges in our account payable policy, marketing initiatives or investments we may decide to pursue.If these resources are insufficient to satisfy our cashrequirements, we may seek to obtain a credit facility or sell additional equity or debt securities.The sale of additional equity securities could result indilution of our existing shareholders.The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating andfinancing covenants that would restrict our operations.It is uncertain whether financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.37Table of ContentsWe may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position.We regard our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, know-how, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to oursuccess, and we rely on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual arrangements, including confidentiality, invention assignment and non-compete agreements with our employees and others, to protect our proprietary rights.Although we are not aware of any copycat websites that attempt tocause confusion or diversion of traffic from us at the moment, we may become an attractive target to such attacks in the future because of our brandrecognition in the online retail industry in China.Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated,circumvented or misappropriated, or such intellectual property may not be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages.In addition, there can be noassurance that our patent applications will be approved, that any issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property, or that such patents will notbe challenged by third parties or found by a judicial authority to be invalid or unenforceable.Further, because of the rapid pace of technological change inour industry, parts of our business rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtainlicenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms.It is often difficult to register, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights in China.Statutory laws and regulations are subject to judicialinterpretation and enforcement and may not be applied consistently due to the lack of clear guidance on statutory interpretation.Confidentiality, inventionassignment and non-compete agreements may be breached by counterparties, and there may not be adequate remedies available to us for any such breach.Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights or to enforce our contractual rights in China.Policing anyunauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly and the steps we take may be inadequate to prevent the infringement or misappropriationof our intellectual property.In the event that we resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, such litigation could result in substantial costsand a diversion of our managerial and financial resources, and could put our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated or narrowed in scope.We canprovide no assurance that we will prevail in such litigation, and even if we do prevail, we may not obtain a meaningful recovery.In addition, our trade secretsmay be leaked or otherwise become available to, or be independently discovered by, our competitors.Any failure in maintaining, protecting or enforcing ourintellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may be expensive to defend and may disrupt our business and operations.We cannot be certain that our operations or any aspects of our business do not or will not infringe upon or otherwise violate patents, copyrights orother intellectual property rights held by third parties.We have been, and from time to time in the future may be, subject to legal proceedings and claimsrelating to the intellectual property rights of others.In addition, there may be other third party intellectual property that is infringed by our products, servicesor other aspects of our business.There could also be existing patents of which we are not aware that our products may inadvertently infringe.We cannotassure you that holders of patents purportedly relating to some aspect of our technology platform or business, if any such holders exist, would not seek toenforce such patents against us in China, the United States or any other jurisdictions.Further, the application and interpretation of China's patent laws andthe procedures and standards for granting patents in China are still evolving and are uncertain, and we cannot assure you that PRC courts or regulatoryauthorities would agree with our analysis.If we are found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others, we may be subject to liability for ourinfringement activities or may be prohibited from using such intellectual38Table of Contentsproperty, and we may incur licensing fees or be forced to develop alternatives of our own.In addition, we may incur significant expenses, and may be forcedto divert management's time and other resources from our business and operations to defend against these third-party infringement claims, regardless of theirmerits.Successful infringement or licensing claims made against us may result in significant monetary liabilities and may materially disrupt our business andoperations by restricting or prohibiting our use of the intellectual property in question.Finally, we use open source software in connection with our productsand services.Companies that incorporate open source software into their products and services have, from time to time, faced claims challenging theownership of open source software and compliance with open source license terms.As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership ofwhat we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms.Some open source software licenses require users whodistribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and make available any derivativeworks of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost.Any requirement to disclose our source code or pay damages for breach of contract could beharmful to our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have limited insurance coverage which could expose us to significant costs and business disruption.We maintain various insurance policies to safeguard against risks and unexpected events.We have purchased all risk property insurance covering ourinventory and fixed assets such as equipment, furniture and office facilities.We maintain public liability insurance for our business activities at one location.We also provide social security insurance including pension insurance, unemployment insurance, work-related injury insurance and medical insurance forour employees.Additionally, we provide group accident insurance for all employees and supplementary medical insurance for all management and researchand development personnel.However, as the insurance industry in China is still in an early stage of development, insurance companies in China currentlyoffer limited business-related insurance products.We do not maintain business interruption insurance or product liability insurance, nor do we maintain key-man life insurance.We cannot assure you that our insurance coverage is sufficient to prevent us from any loss or that we will be able to successfully claim ourlosses under our current insurance policy on a timely basis, or at all.If we incur any loss that is not covered by our insurance policies, or the compensatedamount is significantly less than our actual loss, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Our founder, chairman and chief executive officer, Mr. Richard Qiangdong Liu, has considerable influence over important corporate matters.Our dual-class voting structure will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others from pursuing any change of control transactionsthat holders of our Class A ordinary shares and ADSs may view as beneficial.Our founder, chairman and chief executive officer, Mr. Richard Qiangdong Liu, has considerable influence over important corporate matters.Ourordinary shares are divided into Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares.Holders of Class A ordinary shares are entitled to one vote per share inrespect of matters requiring the votes of shareholders, while holders of Class B ordinary shares are entitled to twenty votes per share, subject to certainexceptions.Each Class B ordinary share is convertible into one Class A ordinary share at any time by the holder thereof, while Class A ordinary shares are notconvertible into Class B ordinary shares under any circumstances.Upon any transfer of Class B ordinary shares by a holder thereof to any person or entitywhich is not an affiliate of such holder, such Class B ordinary shares shall be automatically and immediately converted into the equal number of Class Aordinary shares.Due to the disparate voting powers associated with our two classes of ordinary shares, as of the date of this prospectus, Mr. Liu beneficiallyowns, and we anticipate that immediately after the completion of this offering, Mr. Liu will beneficially own, 83.5% of the aggregate voting power of ourcompany, including the 16.0% of the aggregate voting power of our company that he may exercise on behalf of Fortune Rising Holdings Limited.Mr. Liu is39Table of Contentsthe sole shareholder and the sole director of Fortune Rising Holdings Limited.Fortune Rising Holdings Limited holds 106,850,910 Class B ordinary shares,representing 16.0% of the aggregate voting power of our company, for the purpose of transferring such shares to the plan participants according to our awardsunder our Original Plans, which were replaced by the 2013 Plan and further by the current Share Incentive Plan, and administers the awards and actsaccording to our instruction.Fortune Rising Holdings Limited exercises this 16.0% of the aggregate voting power of our company following our instruction.Mr.Liu, as the representative of Fortune Rising Holdings Limited, can exercise this 16.0% of the aggregate voting power of our company on behalf ofFortune Rising Holdings Limited.See \"Principal and Selling Shareholders.\"As a result, Mr. Liu has considerable influence over matters such as electingdirectors and approving material mergers, acquisitions or other business combination transactions.In addition, under our current memorandum and articles ofassociation, our board of directors will not be able to form a quorum without Mr. Liu for so long as Mr. Liu remains a director.This concentrated control willlimit your ability to influence corporate matters and could also discourage others from pursuing any potential merger, takeover or other change of controltransactions, which could have the effect of depriving the holders of our Class A ordinary shares and our ADSs of the opportunity to sell their shares at apremium over the prevailing market price.We may be the subject of anti-competitive, harassing, or other detrimental conduct by third parties including complaints to regulatory agencies, negativeblog postings, and the public dissemination of malicious assessments of our business that could harm our reputation and cause us to lose market share,customers and revenues and adversely affect the price of our ADSs.We may be the target of anti-competitive, harassing, or other detrimental conduct by third parties.Such conduct includes complaints, anonymous orotherwise, to regulatory agencies.We may be subject to government or regulatory investigation as a result of such third-party conduct and may be required toexpend significant time and incur substantial costs to address such third-party conduct, and there is no assurance that we will be able to conclusively refuteeach of the allegations within a reasonable period of time, or at all.Additionally, allegations, directly or indirectly against us, may be posted in internet chat-rooms or on blogs or websites by anyone, whether or not related to us, on an anonymous basis.Consumers value readily available information concerningretailers, manufacturers, and their goods and services and often act on such information without further investigation or authentication and without regard toits accuracy.The availability of information on social media platforms and devices is virtually immediate, as is its impact.Social media platforms anddevices immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on the accuracy of the content posted.Information posted may be inaccurate and adverse to us, and it may harm our financial performance, prospects or business.The harm may be immediatewithout affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.Our reputation may be negatively affected as a result of the public dissemination of anonymousallegations or malicious statements about our business, which in turn may cause us to lose market share, customers and revenues and adversely affect theprice of our ADSs.We face risks related to natural disasters, health epidemics and other outbreaks, which could significantly disrupt our operations.Our business could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters or the outbreak of avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, orSARS, influenza A (H1N1), Ebola or another epidemic.Any such occurrences could cause severe disruption to our daily operations, including our fulfillmentinfrastructure and our customer service center, and may even require a temporary closure of our facilities.In May 2008, a severe earthquake hit part ofSichuan province in southwestern China, and in April 2010, another severe earthquake hit part of Qinghai province in western China, and in August 2014,another strong earthquake hit part of Yunnan province in south western China, each of40Table of Contentswhich resulted in significant casualties and property damage.While we did not suffer any loss or experience any significant increase in cost resulting fromthese earthquakes, if a similar disaster were to occur in the future affecting Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu, Shenyang or Xi'an, or any othercity where we have major operations in China, our operations could be materially and adversely affected due to loss of personnel and damages to property,including our inventory and our technology systems.Our operation could also be severely disrupted if our suppliers, customers or business partners wereaffected by such natural disasters or health epidemics.Our auditor, like other independent registered public accounting firms operating in China, is not permitted to be subject to inspection by the PublicCompany Accounting Oversight Board and, as such, investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection.Our independent registered public accounting firm that issued the audit reports included in this prospectus filed with the SEC, as an auditor ofcompanies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), orPCAOB, is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess its compliance with the laws of the United Statesand professional standards.Because our auditor is located in China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without theapproval of the PRC authorities, our auditor, like other independent registered public accounting firms operating in China, is currently not inspected by thePCAOB.Inspections of other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms' audit procedures and qualitycontrol procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality.The inability of the PCAOB to conductinspections of independent registered public accounting firms operating in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor's auditprocedures or quality control procedures.As a result, investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections and lose confidence in our reportedfinancial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements.We may be adversely affected by the outcome of the administrative proceedings brought by the SEC against the Big 4 PRC-based accounting firms.In December 2012, the SEC brought administrative proceedings against the Big 4 accounting firms in China, including our independent registeredpublic accounting firm, alleging that these accounting firms had violated U.S. securities laws and the SEC's rules and regulations thereunder by failing toprovide to the SEC the firms' audit papers and other documents related to certain PRC-based companies that are publicly traded in the United States.On January 22, 2014, the Administrative Law Judge presiding over the matter reached an initial decision that the firms had each violated the SEC'srules of practice by failing to produce the audit work papers and related documents directly to the SEC.The initial decision further determined that each ofthe firms should be censured and barred from practicing before the SEC for a period of six months.The Big 4 PRC-based accounting firms appealed the initialadministrative law decision to the SEC in February 2014.The SEC has granted several extensions for the briefing schedule and the hearings, allowing theBig 4 PRC-based accounting firms and the SEC to find an out-of-court settlement.However, if the potential settlement talks may fail to reach a resolution, theBig 4 PRC-based accounting firms will need to go through the appeal proceedings.The initial administrative law decision will not become effective untiland unless it is endorsed by the Commissioners of the SEC.If the SEC's final decision is decided against the accounting firms, the accounting firms can thenfurther appeal the final decision in the federal appellate courts.While we cannot predict the outcome of the SEC's review, nor that of any subsequent appeal process, if the Big 4 PRC-based accounting firms,including our independent registered public41Table of Contentsaccounting firm, are ultimately temporarily barred from practicing before the SEC, we may not be able to meet the reporting requirements under the ExchangeAct following the listing of our ADSs in the U.S., which may ultimately result in our deregistration by the SEC and delisting from NASDAQ, in which caseour market capitalization may decline sharply and the value of your investment in our ADSs may be significantly reduced.In addition, in May 2014, PRC Ministry of Finance proposed certain draft regulations that would require auditors based outside of China, tocooperate with mainland Chinese auditors with requisite qualifications in order to conduct audit work for mainland Chinese companies and overseas-registered companies with operating entities in mainland China.Since the proposed regulations are in draft form and the interpretation, application orenforcement of such proposed regulations is uncertain.However, if the proposed regulations were to be adopted in their current form, it may be difficult forauditors based outside of China to conduct audit work for U.S. listed companies with operating entities in mainland China, like us.Risks Related to Our Corporate StructureIf the PRC government deems that the contractual arrangements in relation to Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou do not comply with PRC regulatoryrestrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, wecould be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations.Foreign ownership of e-commerce and related businesses, including online retail businesses, is subject to restrictions under current PRC laws andregulations.For example, foreign investors are not allowed to own more than 50% of the equity interests in a value-added telecommunication serviceprovider and any such foreign investor must have experience in providing value-added telecommunications services overseas and maintain a good trackrecord, and foreign investors may engage in the distribution of audio and video products in China only in the form of contractual joint ventures betweenforeign and Chinese investors in accordance with the Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment promulgated in 2011.We are a Cayman Islands company and our PRC subsidiaries Jingdong Century, Star East, Jingbangda and Shanghai Shengdayuan are consideredforeign-invested enterprises.Accordingly, none of these PRC subsidiaries is eligible to provide value-added telecommunication services or sell audio andvideo products in China.As a result, we conduct such business activities through two affiliated PRC entities, Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou.Jingdong360 holds our ICP license as an internet information provider, while Jiangsu Yuanzhou primarily conducts the sale of books and audio and video products.Both Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou are 45% owned by Mr. Richard Qiangdong Liu, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer, and 55%owned by Mr. Jiaming Sun, our employee.Mr. Liu and Mr. Sun are both PRC citizens.We entered into a series of contractual arrangements with Jingdong360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou and their respective shareholders, which enable us to:•exercise effective control over Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou; •receive substantially all of the economic benefits and bear the obligation to absorb substantially all of the losses of Jingdong 360 and JiangsuYuanzhou; and •have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou when and to the extentpermitted by PRC law.Because of these contractual arrangements, we are the primary beneficiary of Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou and hence consolidate theirfinancial results as our variable interest entities.For a detailed discussion of these contractual arrangements, see \"Corporate History and Structure.\"42Table of Contents              In the opinion of Zhong Lun Law Firm, our PRC legal counsel, (i) the ownership structures of Jingdong Century and our variable interest entities inChina, both currently and immediately after giving effect to this offering, comply with all existing PRC laws and regulations; and (ii) the contractualarrangements between Jingdong Century, our variable interest entities and their respective shareholders governed by PRC law are valid, binding andenforceable, and will not result in any violation of PRC laws or regulations currently in effect.However, our PRC legal counsel has also advised us that thereare substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations and rules; accordingly, the PRCregulatory authorities may take a view that is contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel.It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws or regulationsrelating to variable interest entity structures will be adopted or if adopted, what they would provide.If we or any of our variable interest entities are found tobe in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals, the relevant PRCregulatory authorities would have broad discretion to take action in dealing with such violations or failures, including:•revoking the business licenses of such entities; •discontinuing or restricting the conduct of any transactions between certain of our PRC subsidiaries and variable interest entities; •imposing fines, confiscating the income from our variable interest entities, or imposing other requirements with which we or our variableinterest entities may not be able to comply; •requiring us to restructure our ownership structure or operations, including terminating the contractual arrangements with our variable interestentities and deregistering the equity pledges of our variable interest entities, which in turn would affect our ability to consolidate, deriveeconomic interests from, or exert effective control over our variable interest entities; or •restricting or prohibiting our use of the proceeds of our initial public offering to finance our business and operations in China.The imposition of any of these penalties would result in a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.In addition, it is unclearwhat impact the PRC government actions would have on us and on our ability to consolidate the financial results of Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou inour consolidated financial statements, if the PRC government authorities were to find our legal structure and contractual arrangements to be in violation ofPRC laws and regulations.If the imposition of any of these government actions causes us to lose our right to direct the activities of Jingdong 360 and JiangsuYuanzhou or our right to receive substantially all the economic benefits and residual returns from Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou and we are not able torestructure our ownership structure and operations in a satisfactory manner, we would no longer be able to consolidate the financial results of Jingdong 360and Jiangsu Yuanzhou in our consolidated financial statements.Either of these results, or any other significant penalties that might be imposed on us in thisevent, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We rely on contractual arrangements with our variable interest entities and their shareholders for a portion of our business operations, which may not beas effective as direct ownership in providing operational control.We have relied and expect to continue to rely on contractual arrangements with Jingdong 360 and its shareholders to hold our ICP license as aninternet information provider, and contractual arrangements with Jiangsu Yuanzhou and its shareholders to conduct the sale of books and audio and videoproducts.Jingdong 360 has an indirect wholly owned subsidiary that holds our online payment license and provides online payment and settlement services.For a description of these contractual43Table of Contentsarrangements, see \"Corporate History and Structure.\"These contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with controlover our variable interest entities.If we had direct ownership of Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou, we would be able to exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect changes in theboard of directors of Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou, which in turn could effect changes, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations, at themanagement level.However, under the current contractual arrangements, we rely on the performance by our variable interest entities and their respectiveshareholders of their obligations under the contracts to exercise control over our variable interest entities.However, the shareholders of our variable interestentities may not act in the best interests of our company or may not perform their obligations under these contracts.Such risks exist throughout the period inwhich we intend to operate our business through the contractual arrangements with our variable interest entities.We may replace the shareholders of ourvariable interest entities at any time pursuant to our contractual arrangements with them and their shareholders.However, if any dispute relating to thesecontracts remains unresolved, we will have to enforce our rights under these contracts through the operations of PRC law and courts and therefore will besubject to uncertainties in the PRC legal system.See \"—Any failure by our variable interest entities or their shareholders to perform their obligations underour contractual arrangements with them would have a material and adverse effect on our business.\"Therefore, our contractual arrangements with our variableinterest entities may not be as effective in ensuring our control over the relevant portion of our business operations as direct ownership would be.Any failure by our variable interest entities or their shareholders to perform their obligations under our contractual arrangements with them would have amaterial and adverse effect on our business.If our variable interest entities or their shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may have toincur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements.We may also have to rely on legal remedies under PRC law, includingseeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages, which we cannot assure you will be effective.For example, if the shareholders ofJingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou were to refuse to transfer their equity interest in Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou to us or our designee when weexercise the purchase option pursuant to these contractual arrangements, or if they were otherwise to act in bad faith toward us, we may have to take legalactions to compel them to perform their contractual obligations.All the agreements under our contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration inChina.Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legalprocedures.The legal system in the PRC is not as developed as in some other jurisdictions, such as the United States.See \"Risks Related to Doing Business inChina—Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us.\"Meanwhile, there are very few precedents and little formal guidance asto how contractual arrangements in the context of a variable interest entity should be interpreted or enforced under PRC law, and as a result it may be difficultto predict how an arbitration panel would view such contractual arrangements.As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability toenforce these contractual arrangements.Additionally, under PRC law, rulings by arbitrators are final, parties cannot appeal the arbitration results in courts,and if the losing parties fail to carry out the arbitration awards within a prescribed time limit, the prevailing parties may only enforce the arbitration awards inPRC courts through arbitration award recognition proceedings, which would require additional expenses and delay.Our variable interest entities hold our ICP license and online payment license and conduct our sales of books and audio and video products(including publication of e-books and online audio and video products) as well as online payment service.In the event we are unable to enforce ourcontractual arrangements, we may not be able to exert effective control over our variable interest44Table of Contentsentities, and our ability to conduct these businesses may be negatively affected.We generate substantially all of our revenues from products and services thatare offered to customers through our website and mobile applications and any interruption in our ability to use our website and mobile applications may havea material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.The shareholders of our variable interest entities may have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our businessand financial condition.Mr. Richard Qiangdong Liu and Mr. Jiaming Sun are the shareholders of each of our variable interest entities, Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou.Mr.Richard Qiangdong Liu is our founder, chairman and chief executive officer, while Mr. Jiaming Sun is an employee of ours.The shareholders of Jingdong360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou may have potential conflicts of interest with us.These shareholders may breach, or cause our variable interest entities to breach,or refuse to renew, the existing contractual arrangements we have with them and our variable interest entities, which would have a material and adverse effecton our ability to effectively control our variable interest entities and receive substantially all the economic benefits from them.For example, the shareholdersmay be able to cause our agreements with Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou to be performed in a manner adverse to us by, among other things, failing toremit payments due under the contractual arrangements to us on a timely basis.We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise, any or all of theseshareholders will act in the best interests of our company or such conflicts will be resolved in our favor.Currently, we do not have any arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest between these shareholders and our company.Mr. RichardQiangdong Liu is also a director and executive officer of our company.We rely on Mr. Liu to abide by the laws of the Cayman Islands and China, whichprovide that directors owe a fiduciary duty to the company that requires them to act in good faith and in what they believe to be the best interests of thecompany and not to use their position for personal gains.If we cannot resolve any conflict of interest or dispute between us and the shareholders of Jingdong360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou, we would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in disruption of our business and subject us to substantialuncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings.We may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, andany limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct ourbusiness.We are a holding company, and we may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiaries like Jingdong Century forour cash and financing requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders and service any debt wemay incur.If these subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends ormake other distributions to us.In addition, the PRC tax authorities may require Jingdong Century to adjust its taxable income under the contractualarrangements it currently has in place with our variable interest entities in a manner that would materially and adversely affect its ability to pay dividendsand other distributions to us.See \"—Contractual arrangements in relation to our variable interest entities may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC taxauthorities and they may determine that we or our PRC variable interest entities owe additional taxes, which could negatively affected our financialcondition and the value of your investment.\"Under PRC laws and regulations, our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China may pay dividends only out of their respective accumulated profitsas determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations.In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise is required to set aside at least10% of its accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve45Table of Contentsfund, until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital.At its discretion, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise may allocate aportion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund.The statutory reserve fund,enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are not distributable as cash dividends.Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us could materially and adversely limit ourability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.Seealso \"—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—If we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC income tax purposes, such classification couldresult in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders or ADS holders.\"PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion maydelay or prevent us from using the proceeds of our initial public offering to make loans to our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entitiesor make additional capital contributions to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity andour ability to fund and expand our business.We are an offshore holding company conducting our operations in China through our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities.We may make loans to our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities subject to the approval from governmental authorities and limitationof amount, or we may make additional capital contributions to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China.Any loans to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China, which are treated as foreign-invested enterprises under PRC law, are subject to PRCregulations and foreign exchange loan registrations.For example, loans by us to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China to finance their activitiescannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the local counterpart of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE.The statutorylimit for the total amount of foreign debts of a foreign-invested company is the difference between the amount of total investment as approved by theMinistry of Commerce or its local counterpart and the amount of registered capital of such foreign-invested company.For example, the current amounts ofapproved total investment and registered capital of Jingdong Century are approximately US$850 million and US$590 million, respectively, which meansJingdong Century cannot obtain loans in excess of US$260 million from our entities outside of China currently.The current statutory limit on the loans toour other wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China, namely, Star East, Jingbangda and Shanghai Shengdayuan, is RMB1,800 million (US$294 million),RMB2,000 million (US$327 million) and US$49 million, respectively.We may also decide to finance our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China by means of capital contributions.These capital contributions mustbe approved by the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterpart.In addition, SAFE issued a circular in September 2008, SAFE Circular No.142, regulatingthe conversion by a foreign-invested enterprise of foreign currency registered capital into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used.SAFECircular No.142 provides that the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used forpurposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC.Inaddition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-investedcompany.The use of such RMB capital may not be altered without SAFE's approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loansif the proceeds of such loans have not been used.Violations of SAFE Circular No.142 could result in severe monetary or other penalties.Furthermore, SAFEpromulgated a circular in November 2010, SAFE Circular No.59, which tightens the regulations over settlement of net proceeds from overseas offerings andrequires that the46Table of Contentssettlement of net proceeds must be consistent with the description in the prospectus for the offering.These two circulars may significantly limit our ability totransfer the net proceeds from our initial public offering to our consolidated variable interest entities and the subsidiaries of our wholly foreign-ownedsubsidiaries in China, and we may not be able to convert the net proceeds into RMB to invest in or acquire any other PRC companies, or establish othervariable interest entities in China.Due to the restrictions imposed on loans in foreign currencies extended to any PRC domestic companies, we are not likely to make such loans to thesubsidiaries of our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China and our consolidated variable interest entities, each a PRC domestic company.Meanwhile, weare not likely to finance the activities of our consolidated variable interest entities by means of capital contributions given the restrictions on foreigninvestment in the businesses that currently conducted by our consolidated variable interest entities.In light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies,including SAFE Circular No.142, SAFE Circular No.59 and other relevant rules and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete thenecessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans to our PRCsubsidiaries or any consolidated variable interest entity or future capital contributions by us to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China.As a result,uncertainties exist as to our ability to provide prompt financial support to our PRC subsidiaries or consolidated variable interest entities when needed.If wefail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to use the proceeds we received from our initial public offering and to capitalize orotherwise fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expandour business.Contractual arrangements in relation to our variable interest entities may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities and they may determine that weor our PRC variable interest entities owe additional taxes, which could negatively affect our financial condition and the value of your investment.Under applicable PRC laws and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC taxauthorities.We could face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that the contractual arrangements between JingdongCentury, our wholly owned subsidiary in China, Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou, our variable interest entities in China, and their respectiveshareholders were not entered into on an arm's-length basis in such a way as to result in an impermissible reduction in taxes under applicable PRC laws, rulesand regulations, and adjust Jingdong 360's and Jiangsu Yuanzhou's income in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment.A transfer pricing adjustment could,among other things, result in a reduction of expense deductions recorded by Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou for PRC tax purposes, which could in turnincrease their tax liabilities.In addition, the PRC tax authorities may impose punitive interest on Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou for the adjusted butunpaid taxes at the rate of 5% over the basic RMB lending rate published by the People's Bank of China for a period according to the applicable regulations.Our financial position could be materially and adversely affected if our variable interest entities' tax liabilities increase or if they are required to pay punitiveinterest.Risks Related to Doing Business in ChinaChanges in China's economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material and adverse effect on our business andoperations.Substantially all of our operations are located in China.Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may beinfluenced to a significant degree by political,47Table of Contentseconomic and social conditions in China generally and by continued economic growth in China as a whole.The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the amount of government involvement,level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources.Although the Chinese government has implemented measuresemphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improvedcorporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government.In addition, the Chinesegovernment continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies.The Chinese government also exercisessignificant control over China's economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, settingmonetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.While the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and amongvarious sectors of the economy.The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation ofresources.Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us.For example, our financial condition andresults of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations.In addition, in the past theChinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate increases, to control the pace of economic growth.These measures may causedecreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our business and operating results.Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us.We conduct our business primarily through our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities in China.Our operations in China aregoverned by PRC laws and regulations.Our PRC subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China.The PRC legalsystem is a civil law system based on written statutes.Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limitedprecedential value.In 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general.Theoverall effect of legislation over the past three decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China.However, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system, and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects ofeconomic activities in China.In particular, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited number of published decisionsand their nonbinding nature, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties.In addition, the PRC legal system isbased in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, and which may have a retroactive effect.As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until some time after the violation.Any administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and managementattention.Since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it maybe more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy than in more developed legalsystems.These uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce the contracts we have entered into and could materially and adversely affect our business andresults of operations.48Table of ContentsWe are subject to consumer protection laws that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs.We are subject to numerous PRC laws and regulations that regulate retailers generally or govern online retailers specifically, such as the ConsumerProtection Law.If these regulations were to change or if we, suppliers or third-party sellers on our marketplace were to violate them, the costs of certainproducts or services could increase, or we could be subject to fines or penalties or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for the products orservices offered on our website and hurt our business and results of operations.For example, the recently amended Consumer Protection Law, which becameeffective in March 2014, further strengthens the protection of consumers and imposes more stringent requirements and obligations on business operators,especially on businesses that operate on the internet.Pursuant to the Consumer Protection Law, consumers are generally entitled to return goods purchasedwithin seven days upon receipt without giving any reasons if they purchased the goods over the internet.Consumers whose interests have been damaged dueto their purchase of goods or acceptance of services on online marketplace platforms may claim damages from sellers or service providers.Where theoperators of an online marketplace platform are unable to provide the real names, addresses and valid contact details of the sellers or service providers, theconsumers may also claim damages from the operators of the online marketplace platforms.Operators of online marketplace platforms that know or shouldhave known that sellers or service providers use their platforms to infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of consumers but fail to take necessarymeasures must bear joint and several liability with the sellers or service providers.Moreover, if business operators deceive consumers or knowingly sellsubstandard or defective products, they should not only compensate consumers for their losses, but also pay additional damages equal to three times the priceof the goods or services.Legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost ofcompliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations.We may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practicesto comply with existing or future laws and regulations, which may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business.We may be adversely affected by the complexity, uncertainties and changes in PRC regulation of internet-related business and companies.The PRC government extensively regulates the internet industry, including foreign ownership of, and the licensing and permit requirementspertaining to, companies in the internet industry.These internet related laws and regulations are relatively new and evolving, and their interpretation andenforcement involve significant uncertainties.As a result, in certain circumstances it may be difficult to determine what actions or omissions may be deemedto be in violation of applicable laws and regulations.Issues, risks and uncertainties relating to PRC government regulation of the internet industry include,but are not limited to, the following:              We only have control over our website through contractual arrangements.We do not own the website in China due to the restriction of foreigninvestment in businesses providing value-added telecommunication services in China, including internet information provision services.This maysignificantly disrupt our business, subject us to sanctions, compromise enforceability of related contractual arrangements, or have other harmful effects on us.The evolving PRC regulatory system for the internet industry may lead to the establishment of new regulatory agencies.For example, in May 2011,the State Council announced the establishment of a new department, the State Internet Information Office (with the involvement of the State CouncilInformation Office, the MIIT, and the Ministry of Public Security).The primary role of this new agency is to facilitate the policy-making and legislativedevelopment in this field to direct and coordinate with the relevant departments in connection with online content administration and to deal with cross-ministry regulatory matters in relation to the internet industry.49Table of Contents              New laws and regulations may be promulgated that will regulate internet activities, including online retail.If these new laws and regulations arepromulgated, additional licenses may be required for our operations.If our operations do not comply with these new regulations at the time they becomeeffective, or if we fail to obtain any licenses required under these new laws and regulations, we could be subject to penalties.The Circular on Strengthening the Administration of Foreign Investment in and Operation of Value-added Telecommunications Business, issued bythe MIIT in July 2006, prohibits domestic telecommunication service providers from leasing, transferring or selling telecommunications business operatinglicenses to any foreign investor in any form, or providing any resources, sites or facilities to any foreign investor for their illegal operation of atelecommunications business in China.According to this circular, either the holder of a value-added telecommunication services operation permit or itsshareholders must directly own the domain names and trademarks used by such license holders in their provision of value-added telecommunication services.The circular also requires each license holder to have the necessary facilities, including servers, for its approved business operations and to maintain suchfacilities in the regions covered by its license.If an ICP license holder fails to comply with the requirements and also fails to remedy such non-compliancewithin a specified period of time, the MIIT or its local counterparts have the discretion to take administrative measures against such license holder, includingrevoking its ICP license.Currently, Jingdong 360, our PRC consolidated variable interest entity, holds an ICP license and operates our website.Jingdong360 owns the relevant domain names and registered trademarks and has the necessary personnel to operate such website.The interpretation and application of existing PRC laws, regulations and policies and possible new laws, regulations or policies relating to theinternet industry have created substantial uncertainties regarding the legality of existing and future foreign investments in, and the businesses and activitiesof, internet businesses in China, including our business.We cannot assure you that we have obtained all the permits or licenses required for conducting ourbusiness in China or will be able to maintain our existing licenses or obtain new ones.Failure to make adequate contributions to various employee benefit plans as required by PRC regulations may subject us to penalties.Companies operating in China are required to participate in various government sponsored employee benefit plans, including certain socialinsurance, housing funds and other welfare-oriented payment obligations, and contribute to the plans in amounts equal to certain percentages of salaries,including bonuses and allowances, of our employees up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time at locations where weoperate our businesses.The requirement of employee benefit plans has not been implemented consistently by the local governments in China given thedifferent levels of economic development in different locations.Our PRC operating entities incorporated in various locations in China have not madeadequate employee benefit payments and we have recorded accruals for estimated underpaid amounts in our financial statements.We may be required tomake up the contributions for these plans as well as to pay late fees and fines.If we are subject to late fees or fines in relation to the underpaid employeebenefits, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.We may be required to register our operating offices outside of our residence addresses as branch offices under PRC law.Under PRC law, a company setting up premises for business operations outside its residence address must register them as branch offices with therelevant local industry and commerce bureau at the place where the premises are located and obtain business licenses for them as branch offices.We had2,045 delivery stations and 1,045 pickup stations in 1,855 counties and districts across China as of September 30, 2014.We seek to register branch offices inall the locations where we have delivery50Table of Contentsstations and pickup stations.However, as of the date of this prospectus, we have not been able to register branch offices in all of these locations.Furthermore,we may expand our fulfillment network in the future to additional locations in China, and we may not be able to register branch offices in a timely mannerdue to complex procedural requirements and relocation of branch offices from time to time.If the PRC regulatory authorities determine that we are inviolation of the relevant laws and regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines, confiscation of income and suspension of operation.If webecome subject to these penalties, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.Regulation and censorship of information disseminated over the internet in China may adversely affect our business, and we may be liable for content thatis displayed on our website.China has enacted laws and regulations governing internet access and the distribution of products, services, news, information, audio-video programsand other content through the internet.In the past, the PRC government has prohibited the distribution of information through the internet that it deems to bein violation of PRC laws and regulations.If any of our internet information were deemed by the PRC government to violate any content restrictions, wewould not be able to continue to display such content and could become subject to penalties, including confiscation of income, fines, suspension of businessand revocation of required licenses, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may also besubject to potential liability for any unlawful actions of our customers or users of our website or for content we distribute that is deemed inappropriate.It maybe difficult to determine the type of content that may result in liability to us, and if we are found to be liable, we may be prevented from operating our websitein China.Fluctuations in exchange rates could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by changes in China's political and economic conditions and China'sforeign exchange policies, among other things.On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decades-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB tothe U.S. dollar, and the RMB appreciated more than 20% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years.Between July 2008 and June 2010, thisappreciation halted and the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band.The PRC government has allowed the RMBto appreciate slowly against the U.S. dollar again, and it has appreciated more than 10% since June 2010, though there also have been periods when it haslost value against the U.S. dollar.It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between theRMB and the U.S. dollar in the future.In addition, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a substantialliberalization of its currency policy, which could result in further appreciation in the value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar.Significant revaluation of the RMB may have a material and adverse effect on your investment.For example, to the extent that we need to convertU.S.dollars into RMB for our operations, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount we wouldreceive from the conversion.Conversely, if we decide to convert our RMB into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our ordinaryshares or ADSs or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the RMB would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amountavailable to us.In addition, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to U.S. dollars would affect our financial results reported in U.S.dollar terms regardless of any underlying change in our business or results of operations.Very limited hedging options are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.To date, we have not entered into anyhedging transactions in an effort to reduce our51Table of Contentsexposure to foreign currency exchange risk.While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of thesehedges may be limited and we may not be able to adequately hedge our exposure or at all.In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified byPRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currency.Governmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively and affect the value of your investment.The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency outof China.We receive substantially all of our revenues in RMB.Under our current corporate structure, our company in the Cayman Islands may rely ondividend payments from our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have.Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations,payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencieswithout prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements.Therefore, our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China are able topay dividends in foreign currencies to us without prior approval from SAFE, subject to the condition that the remittance of such dividends outside of the PRCcomplies with certain procedures under PRC foreign exchange regulation, such as the overseas investment registrations by our shareholders or the ultimateshareholders of our corporate shareholders who are PRC residents.But approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is requiredwhere RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreigncurrencies.The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions.If the foreignexchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to paydividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders, including holders of our ADSs.The approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission may be required in connection with this offering under a regulation adopted in August 2006,and, if required, we cannot predict whether we will be able to obtain such approval.The Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, adopted by six PRC regulatoryagencies in 2006 and amended in 2009, requires an overseas special purpose vehicle formed for listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domesticcompanies and controlled by PRC companies or individuals to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purposevehicle's securities on an overseas stock exchange.In September 2006, the CSRC published a notice on its official website specifying documents andmaterials required to be submitted to it by a special purpose vehicle seeking CSRC approval of its overseas listings.The application of the M&A Rulesremains unclear.Currently, there is no consensus among leading PRC law firms regarding the scope and applicability of the CSRC approval requirement.Our PRC counsel, Zhong Lun Law Firm, has advised us based on their understanding of the current PRC laws, rules and regulations that the CSRC'sapproval is not required for the listing and trading of our ADSs on NASDAQ in the context of this offering, given that:•Jingdong Century, Shanghai Shengdayuan, Star East, Jingbangda and the other wholly foreign-owned enterprises were incorporated as suchby means of direct investment rather than by merger or acquisition of equity interest or assets of a PRC domestic company owned by PRCcompanies or individuals as defined under the M&A Rules that are our beneficial owners; and52Table of Contents•no provision in the M&A Rules clearly classifies contractual arrangements as a type of transaction subject to the M&A Rules.However, our PRC legal counsel has further advised us that there remains some uncertainty as to how the M&A Rules will be interpreted orimplemented in the context of an overseas offering and its opinions summarized above are subject to any new laws, rules and regulations or detailedimplementations and interpretations in any form relating to the M&A Rules.We cannot assure you that relevant PRC government agencies, including theCSRC, would reach the same conclusion as we do.If it is determined that CSRC approval is required for this offering, we may face sanctions by the CSRC orother PRC regulatory agencies for failure to seek CSRC approval for this offering.These sanctions may include fines and penalties on our operations in thePRC, limitations on our operating privileges in the PRC, delays in or restrictions on the repatriation of the proceeds from our initial public offering into thePRC, restrictions on or prohibition of the payments or remittance of dividends by our China subsidiary, or other actions that could have a material andadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our ADSs.The CSRC orother PRC regulatory agencies may also take actions requiring us, or making it advisable for us, to halt this offering before the settlement and delivery of theADSs that we are offering.Consequently, if you engage in market trading or other activities in anticipation of and prior to the settlement and delivery of theADSs we are offering, you would be doing so at the risk that the settlement and delivery may not occur.The M&A Rules and certain other PRC regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, whichcould make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.The M&A Rules discussed in the preceding risk factor and recently adopted regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions establishedadditional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex.Forexample, the M&A Rules require that the Ministry of Commerce be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takescontrol of a PRC domestic enterprise, if (i) any important industry is concerned, (ii) such transaction involves factors that have or may have impact on thenational economic security, or (iii) such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise which holds a famous trademark or PRC time-honored brand.Mergers, acquisitions or contractual arrangements that allow one market player to take control of or to exert decisive impact on anothermarket player must also be notified in advance to the Ministry of Commerce when the threshold under the Provisions on Thresholds for Prior Notification ofConcentrations of Undertakings, or the Prior Notification Rules, issued by the State Council in August 2008 is triggered.In addition, the security review rulesissued by the Ministry of Commerce that became effective in September 2011 specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors that raise \"nationaldefense and security\" concerns and mergers and acquisitions through which foreign investors may acquire de facto control over domestic enterprises thatraise \"national security\" concerns are subject to strict review by the Ministry of Commerce, and the rules prohibit any activities attempting to bypass asecurity review, including by structuring the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement.In the future, we may grow our business byacquiring complementary businesses.Complying with the requirements of the above-mentioned regulations and other relevant rules to complete suchtransactions could be time consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the Ministry of Commerce or its localcounterparts may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions.It is unclear whether our business would be deemed to be in an industry thatraises \"national defense and security\" or \"national security\" concerns.However, the Ministry of Commerce or other government agencies may publishexplanations in the future determining that our business is in an industry subject to the security review, in which case our future acquisitions in the PRC,including those by way of entering into contractual control arrangements with53Table of Contentstarget entities, may be closely scrutinized or prohibited.Our ability to expand our business or maintain or expand our market share through futureacquisitions would as such be materially and adversely affected.PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident beneficial owners orour wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China to liability or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into these subsidiaries, limit these subsidiaries'ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect us.The Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-Raising and Round-Trip Investment Activities of DomesticResidents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, or SAFE Circular No.75, requires PRC residents to register with the relevant local branch ofSAFE before establishing or controlling any company outside of China, referred to as an offshore special purpose company, for the purpose of raising fundsfrom overseas to acquire or exchange the assets of, or acquiring equity interests in, PRC entities held by such PRC residents and to update such registration inthe event of any significant changes with respect to that offshore company.SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign ExchangeControl on Domestic Residents' Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, onJuly 4, 2014, which replaced the SAFE Circular No.75.SAFE Circular No.37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connectionwith their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents' legallyowned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE No.Circular 37 as a \"special purpose vehicle.\"Theterm \"control\" under SAFE Circular No.37 is broadly defined as the operation rights, beneficiary rights or decision-making rights acquired by the PRCresidents in the offshore special purpose vehicles or PRC companies by such means as acquisition, trust, proxy, voting rights, repurchase, convertible bondsor other arrangements.SAFE Circular No.37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any changes with respect to the basic informationof the special purpose vehicle, such as changes in a PRC resident individual shareholder, name or operation period; or any significant changes with respect tothe special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or othermaterial event.If the shareholders of the offshore holding company who are PRC residents do not complete their registration with the local SAFE branches,the PRC subsidiaries may be prohibited from distributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshorecompany, and the offshore company may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries.Moreover, failure to comply withSAFE registration and amendment requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of applicable foreign exchangerestrictions.We have requested PRC residents who we know hold direct or indirect interest in our company to make the necessary applications, filings andamendments as required under SAFE Circular No.37 and other related rules.Mr. Richard Qiangdong Liu, our founder and shareholder, has completedrequired registrations with SAFE in relation to our financing and restructuring and will make amendments when needed and required in accordance withSAFE Circular No.37.However, we may not be informed of the identities of all the PRC residents holding direct or indirect interest in our company, and wecannot provide any assurance that these PRC residents will comply with our request to make or obtain any applicable registrations or comply with otherrequirements under SAFE Circular No.37 or other related rules.The failure or inability of our PRC resident shareholders to comply with the registrationprocedures set forth in these regulations may subject us to fines and legal sanctions, restrict our cross-border investment activities, limit the ability of ourwholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China to distribute dividends and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to us, and wemay also be prohibited from injecting additional capital into these54Table of Contentssubsidiaries.Moreover, failure to comply with the various foreign exchange registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC lawfor circumventing applicable foreign exchange restrictions.As a result, our business operations and our ability to distribute profits to you could be materiallyand adversely affected.Any failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding the registration requirements for employee stock incentive plans may subject the PRC planparticipants or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions.Pursuant to the Notice on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan ofOverseas Publicly Listed Company, issued by SAFE in February 2012, employees, directors, supervisors and other senior management participating in anystock incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company who are PRC citizens or who are non-PRC citizens residing in China for a continuous period ofnot less than one year, subject to a few exceptions, are required to register with SAFE through a domestic qualified agent, which could be a PRC subsidiary ofsuch overseas listed company, and complete certain other procedures.We and our directors, executive officers and other employees who are PRC citizens orwho reside in the PRC for a continuous period of not less than one year and who have been granted restricted shares, restricted share units or options aresubject to these regulations.Failure to complete the SAFE registrations may subject them to fines and legal sanctions and may also limit our ability tocontribute additional capital into our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China and limit these subsidiaries' ability to distribute dividends to us.We alsoface regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our ability to adopt additional incentive plans for our directors and employees under PRC law.In addition, the State Administration for Taxation has issued certain circulars concerning employee share options or restricted shares.Under thesecirculars, the employees working in the PRC who exercise share options or are granted restricted shares will be subject to PRC individual income tax.ThePRC subsidiaries of such overseas listed company have obligations to file documents related to employee share options or restricted shares with relevant taxauthorities and to withhold individual income taxes of those employees who exercise their share options.If the employees fail to pay or the PRC subsidiariesfail to withhold their income taxes according to relevant laws and regulations, the PRC subsidiaries may face sanctions imposed by the tax authorities orother PRC government authorities.Our business benefits from certain financial incentives and discretionary policies granted by local governments.Expiration of, or changes to, theseincentives or policies would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.In the past, local governments in China granted certain financial incentives from time to time to our PRC subsidiaries or consolidated variableinterest entities as part of their efforts to encourage the development of local businesses.We received approximately RMB26 million, RMB42 million,RMB120 million and RMB116 million (US$19 million) in financial incentives from local governments relating to our business operations in 2011, 2012and 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively.The timing, amount and criteria of government financial incentives are determinedwithin the sole discretion of the local government authorities and cannot be predicted with certainty before we actually receive any financial incentive.Wegenerally do not have the ability to influence local governments in making these decisions.Local governments may decide to reduce or eliminate incentivesat any time.We cannot assure you of the continued availability of the government incentives currently enjoyed by our PRC subsidiaries or consolidatedvariable interest entities.Any reduction or elimination of incentives would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.55Table of ContentsIf we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC income tax purposes, such classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us andour non-PRC shareholders or ADS holders.Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with \"de facto managementbody\" within the PRC is considered a resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income tax on its global income at the rate of 25%.Theimplementation rules define the term \"de facto management body\" as the body that exercises full and substantial control and overall management over thebusiness, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise.On April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued a circular, knownas Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the \"de facto management body\" of a PRC-controlled enterprise that isincorporated offshore is located in China.Although this circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups,not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the State Administration of Taxation's general positionon how the \"de facto management body\" text should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises.According to Circular 82, anoffshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its \"defacto management body\" in China and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its global income only if all of the following conditions are met:(i) the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; (ii) decisions relating to the enterprise's financial and human resourcematters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii) the enterprise's primary assets, accounting books and records,company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in the PRC; and (iv) at least 50% of voting board members or seniorexecutives habitually reside in the PRC.We believe that none of JD.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes.See \"Taxation—People'sRepublic of China Taxation.\"However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remainwith respect to the interpretation of the term \"de facto management body.\"If the PRC tax authorities determine that JD.com, Inc. or any of its subsidiariesoutside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, they would be subject to a 25% enterprise income tax on their globalincome.If these entities derive income other than dividends from their wholly owned subsidiaries in the PRC, a 25% enterprise income tax on their globalincome may increase our tax burden.If JD.com, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries outside of China is classified as a PRC resident enterprise, dividends paid to itfrom its wholly owned subsidiaries in China may be regarded as tax-exempted income if such dividends are deemed to be \"dividends between qualified PRCresident enterprises\" under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules.However, we cannot assure you that such dividends will not besubject to PRC withholding tax, as the PRC tax authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing ofoutbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for PRC income tax purposes.In addition, if JD.com, Inc. is classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes, we may be required to withhold a 10% withholding taxfrom dividends we pay to our shareholders that are non-resident enterprises, including the holders of our ADSs.In addition, non-resident enterpriseshareholders (including our ADS holders) may be subject to a 10% PRC withholding tax on gains realized on the sale or other disposition of ADSs orordinary shares, if such income is treated as sourced from within the PRC.It is unclear whether our non-PRC individual shareholders (including our ADSholders) would be subject to any PRC tax on dividends or gains obtained by such non-PRC individual shareholders in the event we are determined to be aPRC resident enterprise.If any PRC tax were to apply to such dividends or gains, it would generally apply at a rate of 20% unless a reduced rate is availableunder an applicable tax treaty.However, it is also unclear whether non-PRC56Table of Contentsshareholders of JD.com, Inc. would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event thatJD.com, Inc. is treated as a PRC resident enterprise.Under the Arrangement Between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Preventionof Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, the dividend withholding tax rate may be reduced to 5%, if a Hong Kong resident enterpriseis considered a non-PRC tax resident enterprise and holds at least 25% of the equity interests in the PRC enterprise distributing the dividends, subject toapproval of the PRC local tax authority.However, if the Hong Kong resident enterprise is not considered to be the beneficial owner of such dividends underapplicable PRC tax regulations, such dividends may remain subject to withholding tax at a rate of 10%.In October 2009, the State Administration ofTaxation issued a circular, known as Circular 601, which provides guidance on determining whether an enterprise is a \"beneficial owner\" under China's taxtreaties and tax arrangements.Circular 601 provides that, in order to be a beneficial owner, an entity generally must be engaged in substantive businessactivities, and that a company that is set up for the purpose of avoiding or reducing taxes or transferring or accumulating profits will not be regarded as abeneficial owner and will not qualify for treaty benefits such as preferential dividend withholding tax rates.If our Hong Kong subsidiaries are, in the light ofCircular 601, considered to be a non-beneficial owner for purposes of the tax arrangement mentioned above, any dividends paid to them by our whollyforeign-owned PRC subsidiaries would not qualify for the preferential dividend withholding tax rate of 5%, but rather would be subject to a rate of 10%.We face uncertainties with respect to the application of the Circular on Strengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers byNon-PRC Resident Enterprises.Pursuant to the Circular on Strengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, knownas SAT Circular 698, issued by the State Administration of Taxation in 2009 with retroactive effect from 2008, and another notice subsequently issued in2011, where a non-resident enterprise transfers the equity interests of a PRC resident enterprise indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseasholding company, or an Indirect Transfer, and the overseas holding company is located in a tax jurisdiction that: (i) has an effective tax rate, which refers tothe effective tax on the gain derived from the disposition of equity interests of the overseas holding company, of less than 12.5% or (ii) does not imposeincome tax on the gain derived from the disposition of equity interests of the overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor,must report to the relevant tax authority of the PRC resident enterprise this Indirect Transfer.Using a \"substance over form\" principle, the PRC tax authoritymay disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing,avoiding or deferring PRC tax.As a result, gains derived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10%.SATCircular 698 also provides that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its related parties at a pricelower than the fair market value, the relevant tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable income of the transaction.Inaddition, the PRC \"resident enterprise\" is supposed to provide necessary assistance to support the enforcement of SAT Circular 698.There is uncertainty as to the application of SAT Circular 698 and its related rules.For example, although the term \"Indirect Transfer\" is not clearlydefined, it is understood that the relevant PRC tax authorities have the authority to request for information over a wide range of foreign entities that have nodirect contact with the PRC.Moreover, the tax authority has not yet promulgated any formal provisions or made any formal announcement as to theprocedure for reporting an Indirect Transfer to the relevant tax authority.In addition, there are not any formal interpretations concerning how to determinewhether a non-resident investor has adopted an abusive arrangement in order to57Table of Contentsreduce, avoid or defer PRC tax.SAT Circular 698 may be determined by the tax authorities to be applicable to our offshore restructuring transactions wherenon-resident investors were involved.The PRC tax authorities may pursue our offshore shareholders to conduct a filing regarding the transactions andrequest our PRC subsidiaries to assist the filing.As a result, we and our non-resident enterprise investors including ADS holders may become at risk of beingtaxed under SAT Circular 698 and may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with SAT Circular 698 or to establish that we and our non-resident enterprise investors should not be taxed under SAT Circular 698 for our previous and future restructuring or disposal of shares of our company,which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or such non-resident enterprise investors' investments in us.Risks Related to This OfferingThe trading price of our ADSs may be volatile.Since our ADSs became listed on NASDAQ on May 22, 2014, the trading price of our ADSs has ranged from US$19.94 to US$33.10 per ADS, and thelast reported trading price on November 21, 2014 was US$24.08 per ADS.The trading prices of our ADSs may be volatile and could fluctuate widely due tofactors beyond our control.This may happen because of broad market and industry factors, like the performance and fluctuation in the market prices or theunderperformance or deteriorating financial results of other listed companies based in China.The securities of some of these companies have experiencedsignificant volatility since their initial public offerings, including, in some cases, substantial price declines in the trading prices of their securities.Thetrading performances of other Chinese companies' securities after their offerings, including internet and e-commerce companies, may affect the attitudes ofinvestors toward Chinese companies listed in the United States, which consequently may impact the trading performance of our ADSs, regardless of ouractual operating performance.In addition, any negative news or perceptions about inadequate corporate governance practices or fraudulent accounting,corporate structure or matters of other Chinese companies may also negatively affect the attitudes of investors towards Chinese companies in general,including us, regardless of whether we have conducted any inappropriate activities.In addition, securities markets may from time to time experiencesignificant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to our operating performance, such as the large decline in share prices in the United States,China and other jurisdictions in late 2008, early 2009 and the second half of 2011, which may have a material and adverse effect on the trading price of ourADSs.In addition to the above factors, the price and trading volume of our ADSs may be highly volatile due to multiple factors, including the following:•regulatory developments affecting us or our industry, customers, suppliers or third-party sellers; •announcements of studies and reports relating to the quality of our product and service offerings or those of our competitors; •changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other online retail or e-commerce companies; •actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and changes or revisions of our expected results; •changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts; •conditions in the online retail market; •announcements by us or our competitors of new product and service offerings, acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures, capitalraisings or capital commitments;58Table of Contents•additions to or departures of our senior management; •fluctuations of exchange rates between the RMB and the U.S. dollar; •release or expiry of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding shares or ADSs; •sales or perceived potential sales of additional ordinary shares or ADSs; and •proceedings instituted recently by the SEC against five PRC-based accounting firms, including our independent registered public accountingfirm.If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the market price for our ADSsand trading volume could decline.The trading market for our ADSs will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business.Ifresearch analysts do not establish and maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our ADSs or publishesinaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the market price for our ADSs would likely decline.If one or more of these analysts cease coverage ofour company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which, in turn, could cause the market price or tradingvolume for our ADSs to decline.Because we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, you must rely on price appreciation of our ADSs for return on your investment.We currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business.As aresult, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.Therefore, you should not rely on an investment in our ADSs as a source for anyfuture dividend income.Our board of directors has complete discretion as to whether to distribute dividends.Even if our board of directors decides to declare and paydividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on, among other things, our future results of operations and cash flow, ourcapital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, received by us from our subsidiaries, our financial condition, contractual restrictions andother factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.Accordingly, the return on your investment in our ADSs will likely depend entirely upon any futureprice appreciation of our ADSs.There is no guarantee that our ADSs will appreciate in value after this offering or even maintain the price at which youpurchased the ADSs.You may not realize a return on your investment in our ADSs and you may even lose your entire investment in our ADSs.Substantial future sales or perceived potential sales of our ADSs in the public market could cause the price of our ADSs to decline.Sales of our ADSs in the public market after this offering, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our ADSs todecline.Upon completion of this offering, we will have 2,763,756,650 ordinary shares outstanding including                        Class A ordinary sharesrepresented by ADSs.All ADSs sold in this offering will be freely transferable without restriction or additional registration under the Securities Act.Theremaining Class A ordinary shares outstanding after this offering and the Class B ordinary shares will be available for sale, subject to volume and otherrestrictions as applicable under Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act and the applicable lock-up agreements.In addition to the 180-day lock-up periodin connection with our initial public offering, we, Max Smart Limited, a company wholly owned by Mr. Richard Qiangdong Liu, our founder, chairman andchief executive officer, Tiger Global entities, the Hillhouse Vehicle, certain DST Global funds and Best Alliance International Holdings Limited have agreed,for a period of 90 days59Table of Contentsafter the date of this prospectus, not to sell any ordinary shares or ADSs for 90 days after the date of this prospectus without the prior written consent of theunderwriters, subject to certain exceptions.See \"Shares Eligible for Future Sales\" and \"Underwriting.\"Any or all of these shares may be released prior to theexpiration of the lock-up period at the discretion of the representatives of the underwriters of this offering.To the extent shares are released before theexpiration of the lock-up period and sold into the market, the market price of our ADSs could decline.After completion of this offering, certain holders of our ordinary shares may cause us to register under the Securities Act the sale of their shares,subject to the applicable lock-up period.Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in ADSs representing these shares becoming freelytradable without restriction under the Securities Act immediately upon the effectiveness of the registration.Sales of these registered shares in the form ofADSs in the public market could cause the price of our ADSs to decline.You, as holders of ADSs, may have fewer rights than holders of our ordinary shares and must act through the depositary to exercise those rights.Holders of ADSs do not have the same rights of our shareholders and may only exercise the voting rights with respect to the underlying Class Aordinary shares in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement.Under our memorandum and articles of association, the minimum notice periodrequired to convene a general meeting is seven days.When a general meeting is convened, you may not receive sufficient notice of a shareholders' meeting topermit you to withdraw your ordinary shares to allow you to cast your vote with respect to any specific matter.In addition, the depositary and its agents maynot be able to send voting instructions to you or carry out your voting instructions in a timely manner.We will make all reasonable efforts to cause thedepositary to extend voting rights to you in a timely manner, but we cannot assure you that you will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that youcan instruct the depositary to vote your ADSs.Furthermore, the depositary and its agents will not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instructionsto vote, for the manner in which any vote is cast or for the effect of any such vote.As a result, you may not be able to exercise your right to vote and you maylack recourse if your ADSs are not voted as you requested.In addition, in your capacity as an ADS holder, you will not be able to call a shareholders' meeting.Except in limited circumstances, the depositary for our ADSs will give us a discretionary proxy to vote the Class A ordinary shares underlying your ADSs ifyou do not vote at shareholders' meetings, which could adversely affect your interests.Under the deposit agreement for the ADSs, if you do not vote, the depositary will give us a discretionary proxy to vote the Class A ordinary sharesunderlying your ADSs at shareholders' meetings unless:•we have instructed the depositary that we do not wish a discretionary proxy to be given; •we have informed the depositary that there is substantial opposition as to a matter to be voted on at the meeting; •a matter to be voted on at the meeting would have a material adverse impact on shareholders; or •the voting at the meeting is to be made on a show of hands.The effect of this discretionary proxy is that you cannot prevent our ordinary shares underlying your ADSs from being voted, except under thecircumstances described above.This may make it more difficult for shareholders to influence the management of our company.Holders of our ordinary sharesare not subject to this discretionary proxy.60Table of ContentsYour right to participate in any future rights offerings may be limited, which may cause dilution to your holdings.We may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities.However, we cannot make rights available toyou in the United States unless we register both the rights and the securities to which the rights relate under the Securities Act or an exemption from theregistration requirements is available.Under the deposit agreement, the depositary will not make rights available to you unless both the rights and theunderlying securities to be distributed to ADS holders are either registered under the Securities Act or exempt from registration under the Securities Act.Weare under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or securities or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to bedeclared effective and we may not be able to establish a necessary exemption from registration under the Securities Act.Accordingly, you may be unable toparticipate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in your holdings.You may not receive cash dividends if the depositary decides it is impractical to make them available to you.The depositary will pay cash dividends on the ADSs only to the extent that we decide to distribute dividends on our Class A ordinary shares or otherdeposited securities, and we do not have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future.To the extent that thereis a distribution, the depositary of our ADSs has agreed to pay to you the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on our Class Aordinary shares or other deposited securities after deducting its fees and expenses.You will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of Class Aordinary shares your ADSs represent.However, the depositary may, at its discretion, decide that it is inequitable or impractical to make a distributionavailable to any holders of ADSs.For example, the depositary may determine that it is not practicable to distribute certain property through the mail, or thatthe value of certain distributions may be less than the cost of mailing them.In these cases, the depositary may decide not to distribute such property to you.You may be subject to limitations on transfer of your ADSs.Your ADSs are transferable on the books of the depositary.However, the depositary may close its transfer books at any time or from time to time whenit deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties.In addition, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of ADSsgenerally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary deems it advisable to do so because of anyrequirement of law or of any government or governmental body, or under any provision of the deposit agreement, or for any other reason.Certain judgments obtained against us by our shareholders may not be enforceable.We are a company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands.We conduct our operations in China and substantially all of our assets arelocated in China.In addition, our directors and executive officers, and some of the experts named in this prospectus, reside within China, and most of theassets of these persons are located within China.As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or against these individualsin the United States in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the U.S. federal securities laws or otherwise.Even if you aresuccessful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Cayman Islands and of the PRC may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assetsor the assets of our directors and officers.For more information regarding the relevant laws of the Cayman Islands and China, see \"Enforceability of CivilLiabilities.\"61Table of ContentsSince we are a Cayman Islands company, the rights of our shareholders may be more limited than those of shareholders of a company organized in theUnited States.Under the laws of some jurisdictions in the United States, majority and controlling shareholders generally have certain fiduciary responsibilities tothe minority shareholders.Shareholder action must be taken in good faith, and actions by controlling shareholders which are obviously unreasonable may bedeclared null and void.Cayman Island law protecting the interests of minority shareholders may not be as protective in all circumstances as the lawprotecting minority shareholders in some U.S. jurisdictions.In addition, the circumstances in which a shareholder of a Cayman Islands company may sue thecompany derivatively, and the procedures and defenses that may be available to the company, may result in the rights of shareholders of a Cayman Islandscompany being more limited than those of shareholders of a company organized in the United States.Furthermore, our directors have the power to take certain actions without shareholder approval which would require shareholder approval under thelaws of most U.S. jurisdictions.The directors of a Cayman Islands company, without shareholder approval, may implement a sale of any assets, property, partof the business, or securities of the company.Our ability to create and issue new classes or series of shares without shareholder approval could have the effectof delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control without any further action by our shareholders, including a tender offer to purchase our ordinaryshares at a premium over then current market prices.We will not receive any proceeds from this offering.However, we continue to retain broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from our initial publicoffering.We will not receive any proceeds from this offering, however, we will continue to retain broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds fromour initial public offering and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not produce income or increase our ADS price.A significant portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering is allocated for general corporate purposes, including funding potentialinvestments in and acquisitions of complementary businesses, assets and technologies.Our management will have considerable discretion in the applicationof the net proceeds received by us.Shareholders will not have the opportunity to influence our management's decisions on how to use the net proceeds.Thenet proceeds may be used for corporate purposes that do not improve our efforts to achieve or maintain profitability or increase our ADS price.The netproceeds from our initial public offering may be placed in investments that do not produce income or that lose value.Our failure to apply these fundseffectively could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Our memorandum and articles of association contains anti-takeover provisions that could discourage a third party from acquiring us and adversely affectthe rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares and ADSs.Our memorandum and articles of association contain certain provisions that could limit the ability of others to acquire control of our company,including a dual-class voting structure that gives disproportionate voting power to the Class B ordinary shares held by Max Smart Limited, a companywholly owned by our founder, chairman and chief executive officer, Mr. Richard Qiangdong Liu and of which he is the sole director, and those held byFortune Rising Holdings Limited of which Mr. Liu is the sole shareholder and sole director.We anticipate that Mr. Liu will beneficially own 83.5% of theaggregate voting power of our company, including the 16.0% of the aggregate voting power of our company that he may exercise on behalf of FortuneRising Holdings Limited, immediately following the completion of this offering.Fortune Rising Holdings Limited holds the shares for the purpose oftransferring such shares to the plan participants according to our awards under our Share Incentive Plan, and administers the awards and acts according to ourinstruction, and is therefore treated as our consolidated variable interest entity under U.S. GAAP.In addition, our memorandum and articles of62Table of Contentsassociation also contains a provision that grants authority to our board of directors to establish and issue from time to time one or more series of preferredshares without action by our shareholders and to determine, with respect to any series of preferred shares, the terms and rights of that series.These provisionscould have the effect of depriving our shareholders of the opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over the prevailing market price by discouraging thirdparties from seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender offer or similar transactions.We are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable toU.S.domestic public companies.Because we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the securities rules and regulations inthe United States that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including:•the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing with the SEC of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K; •the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents, or authorizations in respect of a security registered under theExchange Act; •the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability forinsiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and •the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under Regulation FD.We are required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year.In addition, we intend to publish our resultson a quarterly basis as press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of NASDAQ.Press releases relating to financial results and materialevents will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K.However, the information we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive andless timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers.As a result, you may not be afforded the same protections orinformation that would be made available to you were you investing in a U.S. domestic issuer.As a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, we are permitted to adopt certain home country practices in relation to corporate governance mattersthat differ significantly from NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards; these practices may afford less protection to shareholders than they wouldenjoy if we complied fully with NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards.As a Cayman Islands company listed on NASDAQ, we are subject to NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards.However, NASDAQ rulespermit a foreign private issuer like us to follow the corporate governance practices of its home country.Certain corporate governance practices in the CaymanIslands, which is our home country, may differ significantly from NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards.For example, neither the Companies Lawof the Cayman Islands nor our memorandum and articles of association requires a majority of our directors to be independent and we could include non-independent directors as members of our compensation committee and nominating committee, and our independent directors would not necessarily holdregularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.Currently, we do not plan to rely on home country practice with respect to ourcorporate governance.However, if we choose to follow home country practice in the future, our shareholders may be afforded less protection than theyotherwise would under NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards applicable to U.S. domestic issuers.63Table of ContentsWe may be classified as a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes, which could subject United States investorsin the ADSs or ordinary shares to significant adverse tax consequences.Depending upon the value of our assets, which may be determined based, in part, on the market value of our ADSs and ordinary shares, and the natureof our assets and income over time, we could be classified as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for United States federal income tax purposes.Anon-United States corporation, such as our company, will be classified as a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes for any taxable year, if either(i) 75% or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of \"passive\" income or (ii) 50% or more of the value of its assets (determined on thebasis of a quarterly average) during such year produce or are held for the production of passive income.The average percentage of a corporation's assets thatproduce or are held for the production of passive income generally is determined on the basis of the fair market value of the corporation's assets at the end ofeach quarter.This determination is based on the adjusted tax basis of the corporation's assets, however, if the corporation is a \"controlled foreigncorporation,\" or CFC, that is not a publicly traded corporation for the taxable year.If we are treated as a CFC for United States federal income tax purposes forany portion of our taxable year that includes this offering, we would likely be classified as a PFIC for our taxable year ending December 31, 2014.Althoughno assurances can be made in this regard, based on our shareholder composition during the taxable year ending December 31, 2014, we believe that we werenot, and we do not expect to be, a CFC for any portion of the taxable year of the offering.In addition, we will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets and earning a proportionate share of the income of any other corporationin which we own, directly or indirectly, more than 25% (by value) of the stock.Although the law in this regard is unclear, we treat our VIEs as being ownedby us for United States federal income tax purposes because we control their management decisions and we are entitled to substantially all of the economicbenefits and obligated to absorb substantially all of the losses associated with these entities, and, as a result, we consolidate their results of operations in ourU.S.GAAP financial statements and treat them as being owned by us for United States federal income tax purposes.If it were determined, however, that thatwe are not the owner of our VIEs for United States federal income tax purposes, we may be treated as a PFIC for our current taxable year and in future taxableyears.Based on our current income and assets and the value of our ADSs and outstanding ordinary shares, we do not expect to be classified as a PFIC for ourtaxable year ending December 31, 2014 or in the foreseeable future.Because PFIC status is a fact-intensive determination and our expectation for our taxableyear ending December 31, 2014 is based, in part, on our belief that were not and will not become a CFC for any portion of our taxable year that includes thisoffering, no assurance can be given that we will not be classified as a PFIC.While we do not anticipate becoming a PFIC, changes in the nature of our incomeor assets, or fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs or ordinary shares, may cause us to become a PFIC for future taxable years.In estimating the value ofour goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, we have taken into account our market capitalization, which may fluctuate over time.Among other factors, ifour market capitalization subsequently declines following the offering, we may be or become classified as a PFIC for the current or future taxable years.Under circumstances where revenues from activities that produce passive income significantly increase relative to our revenues from activities that producenon-passive income or where we determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for working capital or other purposes, our risk of becoming classified asa PFIC may substantially increase.If we are classified as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or ordinary shares, a U.S. Holder may incur significantlyincreased United States federal income tax on gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares and on the receipt ofdistributions on the ADSs or ordinary shares to the extent such gain or distribution is treated as an64Table of Contents\"excess distribution\" under the United States federal income tax rules.If we are so classified, our ADSs or ordinary shares generally will continue to be treatedas shares in a PFIC for all succeeding years during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or ordinary shares, even if we cease to be a PFIC.See the discussionunder \"Taxation—United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules\" concerning the United States federalincome tax consequences of an investment in the ADSs or ordinary shares if we are or become classified as a PFIC, including the possibility of making a\"deemed sale\" election.We will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.As a public company, we incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.The Sarbanes-Oxley Act,as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ, have detailed requirements concerning corporate governance practices of publiccompanies, including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act relating to internal controls over financial reporting.We expect these rules and regulationsapplicable to public companies to increase our accounting, legal and financial compliance costs and to make certain corporate activities more time-consuming and costly.Our management will be required to devote substantial time and attention to our public company reporting obligations and othercompliance matters.We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these rules and regulations, and we cannot predict or estimatethe amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.Our reporting and other compliance obligations as a public company may place astrain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future.In the past, shareholders of a public company often brought securities class action suits against the company following periods of instability in themarket price of that company's securities.If we were involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our management's attention andother resources from our business and operations, which could harm our results of operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit.Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future.In addition, if a claim issuccessfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition andresults of operations.65Table of ContentsSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

obtained from various government and private publications.Statistical data in thesepublications also include projections based on a number of assumptions.The online retail industry may not grow at the rate projected by market data, or atall.Failure of this market to grow at the projected rate may have a material and adverse effect on our business and the market price of our ADSs.In addition,the rapidly changing nature of the online retail industry results in significant uncertainties for any projections or estimates relating to the growth prospects orfuture condition of our

approximately US$                        if theunderwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after deducting underwriting discounts.These estimates are based upon an assumedoffering price of US$                        per ADS, the closing trading price of our ADSs on                        , 2014.We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling shareholders.68Table of ContentsDIVIDEND POLICY               Our board of directors has complete discretion on whether to distribute dividends.Our shareholders may by ordinary resolution declare dividends, butno dividend may exceed the amount recommended by our directors.Even if our board of directors decides to pay dividends, the form, frequency and amountwill depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factorsthat the board of directors may deem relevant.We do not have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future after this offering.We currently intend toretain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business.We are a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands.We may rely on dividends from our subsidiaries in China for our cash requirements,including any payment of dividends to our shareholders.PRC regulations may restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to us.See \"RiskFactors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure—We may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiaries to fund anycash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material andadverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.\"If we pay any dividends, we will pay our ADS holders to the same extent as holders of our ordinary shares, subject to the terms of the depositagreement, including the fees and expenses payable thereunder.See \"Description of American Depositary Shares.\"Cash dividends on our ordinary shares, ifany, will be paid in U.S. dollars.69Table of ContentsCAPITALIZATION               The following table sets forth our capitalization as of September 30, 2014:              You should read this table

associated with being a Cayman Islands exempted company, such as:•political and economic stability; •an effective judicial system; •a favorable tax system; •the absence of exchange control or currency restrictions; and •the availability of professional and support services.However, certain disadvantages accompany incorporation in the Cayman Islands.These disadvantages include:•the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States and provides significantly less protection toinvestors; and •Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the United States.Our constituent documents do not contain provisions requiring that disputes, including those arising under the securities laws of the United States,between us, our officers, directors and shareholders, be arbitrated.Substantially all of our operations are conducted in China, and substantially all of our assets are located in China.A majority of our directors andexecutive officers are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the UnitedStates.As a result, it may be difficult for a shareholder to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons, or to enforce against us or themjudgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States orany state in the United States.We have appointed Law Debenture Corporate Services Inc., located at 400 Madison Avenue 4th Floor, New York, New York 10017 as our agent uponwhom process may be served in any action brought against us under the securities laws of the United States.We have been informed by Maples and Calder, our counsel as to Cayman Islands law, that the United States and the Cayman Islands do not have atreaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters and that a final judgment for thepayment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. federalsecurities laws, would not be automatically enforceable in the Cayman Islands.We have also been advised by Maples and Calder that a final and conclusivejudgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts under which a sum of money is payable as compensatory damages (i.e., not being a sum claimed by arevenue authority for taxes or other charges of a similar nature by a governmental authority, or in respect of a fine or penalty or multiple or punitive damages)will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands at common law, without any re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, byan action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, provided that:•the court that gave the judgment was competent to hear the action in accordance with private international law principles as applied by thecourts in the Cayman Islands; and •the judgment was not obtained in a manner and is not of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or public policy in theCayman Islands.73Table of Contents              A Cayman Islands court may impose civil liability on us or our directors or officers in a suit brought in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands againstus or these persons with respect to a violation of U.S. federal securities laws, provided that the facts surrounding any violation constitute or give rise to acause of action under Cayman Islands law.Our shareholders can, under certain circumstances, originate actions against us in the Cayman Islands.See\"Description of Share Capital—Differences in Corporate Law—Shareholders' Suits.\"Zhong Lun Law Firm, our counsel as to PRC law, has advised us that there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of China would:•recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the civil liabilityprovisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States; or •entertain original actions brought in each respective jurisdiction against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the securities laws ofthe United States or any state in the United States.Zhong Lun Law Firm has further advised us that the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC CivilProcedures Law.PRC courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based eitheron treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions.China does not have any treatiesor other form of reciprocity with the United States or the Cayman Islands that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments.Inaddition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if theydecide that the judgment violates the basic principles of PRC law or national sovereignty, security or public interest.As a result, it is uncertain whether andon what basis a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States or the Cayman Islands.Under the PRC Civil Procedures Law,foreign shareholders may originate actions based on PRC law against us in the PRC, if they can establish sufficient nexus to the PRC for a PRC court to havejurisdiction, and meet other procedural requirements, including, among others, the plaintiff must have a direct interest in the case, and there must be aconcrete claim, a factual basis and a cause for the suit.However, it would be difficult for foreign shareholders to establish sufficient nexus to the PRC byvirtue only of holding our ADSs or ordinary shares.74Table of ContentsCORPORATE HISTORY AND STRUCTURE               Our founder, Mr. Richard Qiangdong Liu, launched an online retail website in January 2004.He subsequently formed a company in Beijing andanother company in Shanghai and conducted his online retail business through these two companies.In November 2006, we incorporated Star WaveInvestments Holdings Limited under the laws of the British Virgin Islands as our offshore holding company in order to facilitate international financing.Welater changed the name of this entity to 360buy Jingdong Inc.In January 2014, 360buy Jingdong Inc. was redomiciled in the Cayman Islands as an exemptedcompany registered under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and was renamed JD.com, Inc.In April 2007, we established a wholly owned PRC subsidiary, Beijing Jingdong Century Trade Co., Ltd., or Jingdong Century, and we acquiredcertain intellectual property rights from the two companies our founder had established earlier, which ceased business operations and were later liquidatedand dissolved.Since then, Jingdong Century has established a variety of subsidiaries in China to engage in wholesale and retail sales, courier services,research and development, and internet finance.We assisted in establishing Beijing Jingdong 360 Degree E-Commerce Co., Ltd., or Jingdong 360, in April 2007.Mr. Richard Qiangdong Liu andMr.Jiaming Sun are the shareholders of Jingdong 360, with Mr. Liu owning 45% and Mr. Sun owning 55% as of the date of this prospectus.We obtainedcontrol over Jingdong 360 through Jingdong Century in April 2007 by entering into a series of contractual arrangements with Jingdong 360 and theshareholders of Jingdong 360 which we refer to as the Jingdong 360 Agreements.The Jingdong 360 Agreements were subsequently amended and restated inApril 2011 and again in May 2012, and some of the Jingdong 360 Agreements were further amended and restated in December 2013.Jingdong 360 holds ourICP license as an internet information provider and operates our website www.jd.com.In October 2012, Jingdong 360 acquired, through its wholly ownedsubsidiary, an online payment service provider which currently holds our online payment license and provides online payment services.We assisted in establishing Jiangsu Yuanzhou E-Commerce Co., Ltd., or Jiangsu Yuanzhou, in September 2010.Mr. Richard Qiangdong Liu andMr.Jiaming Sun are also the shareholders of Jiangsu Yuanzhou, with Mr. Liu owning 45% and Mr. Sun owning 55% as of the date of this prospectus.Weobtained control over Jiangsu

discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in thisprospectus.This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business and operations.Our actual results may differ materially from those wecurrently anticipate as a result of many factors, including those we describe under \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this prospectus.See \"Special NoteRegarding Forward-Looking Statements\".Overview              We are the largest online direct sales company in China in terms of transaction volume in the third quarter of 2014, with a market share in China of51.9%, according to iResearch.Our GMV increased from RMB32.7 billion in 2011 to RMB73.3 billion in 2012 and RMB125.5 billion in 2013, and furtherto RMB213.5 billion (US$34.8 billion) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.Our primary business model is online direct sales, where we acquire products from suppliers and sell them directly to our customers through ourwebsite and mobile applications.We introduced an online marketplace in October 2010 to broaden our selection of products and further enrich customerexperience.In our online marketplace business, third-party sellers sell products to customers through our website and mobile applications and these sellersmay also use our fulfillment and other value-added services.We have also begun to offer other services such as advertising, transaction processing andinternet financing.Our business has grown substantially in recent years.The number of products we offer has grown rapidly.We had 12.5 million, 29.3 million,47.4 million and 82.8 million active customer accounts and fulfilled approximately 65.9 million, 193.8 million, 323.3 million and 582.9 million orders in2011, 2012 and 2013 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, respectively.Our total net revenues increased from RMB21.1 billion in 2011 toRMB41.4 billion in 2012 and RMB69.3 billion in 2013, and increased from RMB49.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 toRMB80.3 billion (US$13.1 billion) for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.We had net losses of RMB1.3 billion, RMB1.7 billion, RMB0.05 billionand RMB4.5 billion (US$0.7 billion) in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively.Due to the PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership of companies that engage in a value-added telecommunications service business or thedistribution of media products in China, we conduct the relevant parts of our operations through two consolidated variable interest entities, Jingdong 360and Jiangsu Yuanzhou.We have contractual arrangements with these entities and their shareholders that enable us to effectively control and receivesubstantially all of the economic benefits from the entities.Accordingly, we consolidate the results of these entities in our financial statements.Major Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations              Our results of operations and financial condition are affected by the general factors driving China's retail industry, including levels of per capitadisposable income and consumer spending in China.In addition, they are also affected by factors driving online retail in China, such as the growing numberof online shoppers, the adoption of online sales strategies by manufacturers and service providers, the availability of improved delivery services and theincreasing variety of payment options.Our results of operations are also affected by general economic conditions in China.In particular, we haveexperienced and expect to continue to experience upward pressure on our operating expenses.Our results of operations are also affected by PRC regulations and industry policies related to our business operations, licenses and permits andcorporate structure.For example, the product quality and consumer protection laws require us to ensure the quality of the goods we sell and give customers85Table of Contentsthe right to return goods within seven days of receipt with no questions asked, the labor contract law and related rules require employers to enter into writtencontracts with workers and to pay compensation to workers who are terminated under certain circumstances, regulations on foreign ownership and on transferof funds into and out of China affect our corporate structure and financing, and regulations on business licenses affect our legal and compliance functions.For a summary of the principal PRC laws and regulations that affect us, see \"Risk Factors\" and \"Regulations\" sections.Although we have generally benefitedfrom the Chinese government's policies to encourage economic growth, we are also affected by the complexity, uncertainties and changes in PRC regulationsgoverning various aspects of our operations.For a detailed description of the PRC regulations applicable to us, see \"Regulation.\"In terms of PRC regulations that may affect our results of operations, the amendments to the Consumer Protection Law that came into effect in March2014 give consumers the right to return goods within seven days of receipt.Although we recognize revenues net of return allowances, we do not expect theamendments to the Consumer Protection Law will affect our net revenues.We have adopted shipping policies that do not necessarily pass the full cost ofshipping on to our customers.We also have adopted customer-friendly return and exchange policies that make it convenient and easy for customers tochange their minds after completing purchases.However, if we experience an increased volume of returns after the amendments to the Consumer ProtectionLaw became effective, our shipping and handling costs and related personnel costs may increase significantly and our results of operations may be materiallyand adversely affected.If we revise our policies to pass these costs to customers, our customers may be dissatisfied, which may result in loss of existingcustomers or adversely affect our ability to acquire new customers, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our results of operations.JD.com, Inc., the holding company that is listed on the NASDAQ, has no material operations of its own.We conduct our operations primarily throughour subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities in China.As a result, JD.com, Inc.'s ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, includinginvestors who purchase our shares in this offering, depends in part upon dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries subject to compliance with applicable PRCregulations.Our wholly-owned PRC subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends to us only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordancewith PRC accounting standards and regulations.Under PRC regulations, each of our wholly-owned PRC subsidiaries is required to set aside at least 10% ofits after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds until such reserve funds reach 50% of its registered capital.In addition, each of ourwholly-owned PRC subsidiaries in China may allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to enterprise expansion fund andstaff bonus and welfare fund at its discretion, which are not distributable as cash dividends.Remittance of dividends by a wholly foreign-owned company outof China is subject to examination by the banks designated by SAFE.As of September 30, 2014, the amount restricted, including paid-in capital andstatutory reserve funds, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations, was approximately RMB13,996 million(US$2,280 million).Our PRC subsidiaries have never paid dividends and will not be able to pay dividends until they generate accumulated profits and meetthe requirements for statutory reserve funds.While our business is influenced by general factors affecting our industry, our operating results are more directly affected by company specificfactors, including the following major factors:•our ability to increase active customer accounts and orders from customers; •our ability to manage our mix of product and service offerings; •our ability to further increase and leverage our scale of business; and •our ability to effectively invest in our fulfillment infrastructure and technology platform.86Table of ContentsOur Ability to Increase Active Customer Accounts and Orders from Customers              Growth in the number of our active customer accounts and orders are key drivers of our revenue growth.Our active customer accounts increased from12.5 million in 2011 to 29.3 million in 2012 and 47.4 million in 2013, further to 82.8 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.This increasewas primarily driven by our success in attracting new active customer accounts, as well as by our success in attracting new orders from existing customeraccounts.During the same period, total orders we fulfilled also increased substantially from approximately 65.9 million in 2011 to approximately193.8 million in 2012 and approximately 323.3 million in 2013, and further to 582.9 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.Our ability to attract new customer accounts and new orders from existing customer accounts depends on our ability to provide superior customerexperience.To this end, we offer a wide selection of authentic products at competitive prices on our website and mobile applications and provide speedy andreliable delivery, convenient online and in-person payment options and comprehensive customer services.The number of products we offer has grownrapidly.We have developed a business intelligence system that enables us to increase our operating efficiency through enhanced product merchandising andsupply chain management capabilities, and to drive more targeted and relevant product promotions and recommendations to our customers.We havebenefited from word-of-mouth viral marketing in winning new customers, and we also conduct online and offline marketing and brand promotion activitiesto attract new customers.In addition, we encourage existing customers to place more orders with us through a variety of means, including granting couponsand loyalty points and holding special promotions.We have a growing and loyal active customer base.Over the years, our customers have shown loyalty to us through their increased activity levels.Forexample, those customer accounts that were active in 2008 increased their average number of purchases each year thereafter, from approximately 3.7 in 2008to 4.4 in 2009, 6.2 in 2010, 10.7 in 2011, 14.9 in 2012 and 16.6 in 2013.Our Ability to Manage Our Mix of Product and Service Offerings              Our results of operations are also affected by the mix of products and services we offer.We commenced our e-commerce business by primarily sellingelectronics and home appliances products.We began offering general merchandise products around the end of 2008, and we launched our online marketplacein 2010.We earn commissions and service fees from third-party sellers on our online marketplace.We offer a wide range of products and services and aim toprovide one-stop shopping to maximize our wallet share.Our mix of products and services also affects our gross margin.Different products have differentgross margins but the commissions and service fees that we earn from third-party sellers and the other services that we offer have the highest gross margins,since they have no associated cost of revenues.The split between our online direct sales business and our online marketplace business thus has a majorinfluence on our revenue growth and our gross margins.GMV from our online direct sales increased from RMB29.8 billion in 2011 to RMB56.7 billion in2012 and RMB93.7 billion in 2013, and further to RMB138.3 billion (US$22.5 billion) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.GMV from ouronline marketplace business increased from RMB2.9 billion in 2011 to RMB16.6 billion in 2012 and RMB31.8 billion in 2013, and further toRMB75.2 billion (US$12.3 billlion) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.We intend to further expand our selection of general merchandiseproducts, attract more third-party sellers to our online marketplace, and provide more fulfillment and other value-added services to third-party sellers andothers.Our GMV from general merchandise and other products represented 19.9%, 34.7%, 36.4% and 43.1% of our total GMV in 2011, 2012, 2013 and thetwelve months ended September 30, 2014, respectively.The following table presents the GMV of the electronics and home appliances products and general87Table of Contentsmerchandise and others sold through our online direct sales and online marketplace by amounts and as percentages of GMV for each of the periods presented:Our Ability to Further Increase and Leverage our Scale of Business              Our results of operations are directly affected by our ability to further increase and leverage our scale of business.As our business further grows inscale, we expect to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers, including pricing terms and volume-based rebates.In addition, we aim to create value for oursuppliers by providing an effective channel for selling large volumes of their products online and by offering them comprehensive information on customerpreferences and market demand and ensuring the high quality of fulfillment services.We believe this value proposition also helps us obtain favorable termsfrom suppliers.As of September 30, 2014, our nationwide fulfillment infrastructure employed a total of 43,133 warehouse and delivery personnel, and we alsoemployed 4,724 IT professionals to monitor, maintain, upgrade and develop the technology platform that manages this fulfillment infrastructure and thelarge number of orders we receive, process and fulfill each year.Our fulfillment expenses in absolute amount increased over 2011, 2012 and 2013 and thenine months ended September 30, 2014, while the fulfillment expenses as a percentage of our total net revenues increased from 7.2% in 2011 to 7.4% in 2012and decreased to 5.9% in 2013 and again increased to 6.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.Personnel costs are the largest component of ourfulfillment costs and of our technology and content costs and are likely to remain the largest component for the foreseeable future as we continue to expandour operations.We expect our fulfillment expenses to increase both in absolute amount and as a percentage of our total net revenues in the near future.Laborcosts are rising in China and we strive to continue improving efficiency and utilization of our fulfillment and other personnel to mitigate this effect.Ourfulfillment expenses and thus operational efficiency are also affected by the average size of orders placed by our customers.Our Ability to Effectively Invest in Our Fulfillment Infrastructure and Technology Platform              Our results of operations depend in part on our ability to invest in our fulfillment infrastructure and technology platform to cost-effectively meet thedemands of our anticipated growth.Our nationwide fulfillment infrastructure included a warehouse network of 118 warehouses with an aggregate gross floorarea of approximately 2.3 million square meters in 39 cities and 2,045 delivery stations and 1,045 pickup stations in 1,855 counties and districts acrossChina as of September 30, 2014.We have acquired land use rights to over 850,000 square meters of land in six cities where we currently have fulfillmentcenters.We plan to build large scale, custom-designed warehouse facilities with optimized configurations on these sites to improve our fulfillment efficiency,minimize order splitting, reduce our reliance on leased warehouses, decrease our rental expenses over time, accommodate88  For the Year Ended December 31, For the TwelveMonths EndedSeptember 30,   2011 2012 2013 2014   RMB   RMB   RMB   RMB     (in billions, except for

purchase of warehousingequipment as of December 31, 2013, and we paid an aggregate of approximately RMB0.8 billion (US$0.1 billion) for these purposes in the nine monthsended September 30, 2014.In selecting locations for our pickup and delivery stations, order density, a parameter we use to measure the frequency andnumber of orders generated from a geographical area, is an important criterion.To efficiently deploy our delivery network, we have established deliverystations and pickup stations in areas where we expect order density to increase to the extent where operating our own delivery network will be more costefficient than using third-party couriers.We also paid significant amounts for upgrading our technology platform during the same periods.To enhance ourtechnology platform, we intend to further invest in technology, including initiatives to provide innovative features, solutions and services to customers andsuppliers, while increasing our operational efficiency.Selected Statements of Operations ItemsNet Revenues              Net revenues are provided from online direct sales and services and others.Online direct sales is further divided into sales of electronics and homeappliances products and general merchandise products.Net revenues from electronics and home appliances products include revenues from sales ofcomputer, communication and consumer electronics products as well as home appliances.The following table breaks down our total net revenues by thesecategories, by amounts and as percentages of total net revenues:              We expect net revenues from all categories to continue to increase in the foreseeable future.Sales of electronics and home appliances products maydecrease as a percentage of our total net revenues and sales from services and others may increase as a percentage of our total net revenues.Net revenues from services and others primarily consist of commissions earned from third-party sellers for sales made through our online marketplaceand service fees we charge them for value-added fulfillment or other services we provide upon their request.Currently, we recognize revenues from the third-party sellers on a net basis as we may not always be the primary obligor, we do not have general inventory risk and we do not have latitude to establish pricesfor them.In addition, net revenues from services and others also include fees we earn by selling advertisements on our website and transaction fees fromprocessing transactions for our online payment service customers, typically e-commerce companies.89  For the Year Ended December 31, For the Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,   2011 2012 2013 2013 2014   RMB % RMB % RMB US$ % RMB % RMB US$ %   (in millions, except for percentages) Online

Control over Financial Reporting              In connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, we and our independentregistered public accounting firm identified one material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.As defined in the standards established bythe U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a \"material weakness\" is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control overfinancial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be preventedor detected on a timely basis.The material weakness that has been identified relates to our lack of sufficient financial reporting and accounting personnel with appropriateknowledge of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements to properly address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and to prepare and review ourconsolidated financial statements and related disclosures to fulfill U.S. GAAP and SEC financial reporting requirements.The material weakness, if not timelyremedied, may lead to significant misstatements in our consolidated financial statements in the future.In connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, we and our independentregistered public accounting firm identified another material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.The other material weakness that wasidentified previously related to our lack of an effective control procedure to track, estimate and record rebates and subsidies provided by our suppliers and toanalyze period-end accruals for supplier rebates and subsidies to ensure completeness and accuracy.We have improved our control procedures on estimatingand recording rebates and subsidies subsequent to December 31, 2012, and remediated this material weakness as of December 31, 2013, by i) allocatingadditional resources to formalize and enhance our existing manual tracking and recording process, ii) providing additional training for management and staffin the relevant business departments, iii) establishing a business review process over the rebates and subsidies to identify and mitigate potential errors on atimely basis and92Table of Contentsiv) implementing effective internal audit functions for the estimates and reviews of rebates and subsidies.To further improve efficiency of our internalcontrols over vendor rebates and subsidies, in January 2014, we launched a new system and established an efficient systematic process with necessary manualinput to collect, record and track the information on rebates and subsidies, which we will further improve and enhance over the rest of 2014.We have implemented and plan to implement a number of measures to address the material weakness that has been identified in connection with theaudits of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013.We have hired additional qualified financial and accountingstaff with extensive U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience, including our new chief financial officer.We have allocated additional resources to improvefinancial oversight function, to introduce formal business performance review process, and to prepare and review the consolidated financial statements andrelated disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements.Furthermore, we will continue to hire additional competent accountingstaff with appropriate knowledge and experience of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements.We have also established an ongoing program to providesufficient and additional appropriate training to our accounting staff, especially training related to U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements.We have alsobeen making continuous efforts to further enhance our internal audit function to enhance our monitoring of U.S. GAAP accounting and reporting matters.However, we cannot assure you that all these measures will be sufficient to remediate our material weakness in time, or at all.See \"Risk Factors—RisksRelated to Our Business—In connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, we and ourindependent registered public

historical unaudited consolidated selected quarterly results of operations for the periods indicated, as a percentageof total net revenues.We experience seasonality in our business, reflecting a combination of seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonalitypatterns.For example, we generally experience less user traffic and purchase orders during national holidays in China, particularly during the ChineseNew Year holiday season in the first quarter of each year.Furthermore, sales in the traditional retail industry are significantly higher in the fourth quarter ofeach calendar year than in the preceding three quarters.E-commerce companies in China hold special promotional campaigns on November 11 each year thatalso tend to boost sales in the fourth quarter relative to other quarters, and we hold a special promotional campaign in the second quarter of each year, onJune 18, to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of our e-commerce business.Overall, the historical seasonality of our business has been relatively milddue to our rapid growth but may increase further in the future.Due to our limited operating history, the seasonal trends that we have experienced in the pastmay not apply to, or be indicative of, our future operating results.100  For the Three Months Ended   March 31,2013 June 30,2013 September 30,2013 December 31,2013 March 31,2014

Working Capital              Our primary sources of liquidity have been proceeds from operating activities, private issuances of ordinary and preferred shares, and our initialpublic offering.In May 2014, we completed our initial public offering in which we issued and sold an aggregate of 83,060,200 ADSs, representing166,120,400 Class A ordinary shares resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately US$1.5 billion.Concurrently with our initial public offering, we alsoraised US$1.3 billion from Huang River Investment Limited, our existing shareholder, by selling 139,493,960 Class A ordinary shares to Huang River viaprivate placement.As of September 30, 2014, we had a total of RMB36.3 billion (US$5.9 billion) in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-terminvestments.This included RMB1.9 billion (US$317.2 million), US$3.0 billion in the United States, RMB28.9 million (US$4.7 million), HK$7.7 million(US$1.0 million) and US$19.2 million in Hong Kong, RMB1.0 billion (US$162.9 million) in the Cayman Islands, and RMB14.6 billion (US$2.4 billion) inChina.Our cash and cash equivalents generally consist of bank deposits and liquid investments with maturities of three months or less.As of September 30,2014, we had one-year revolving lines of credit for an aggregate amount of RMB9.6 billion (US$1.6 billion) from several Chinese commercial banks.We hadRMB3.8 billion (US$0.6 billion) outstanding under these revolving lines of credit as of September 30, 2014.We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next 12 months.We may, however,need additional cash resources in the future if we experience changes in business conditions or other developments.We may also need additional cashresources in the future if we find and wish to pursue opportunities for investment, acquisition, capital expenditure or similar actions.If we determine that ourcash requirements exceed the amount of cash and cash equivalents we have on hand, we may seek to issue debt or equity securities or obtain additional creditfacilities.Our accounts payable primarily include accounts payable to suppliers associated with our online direct sales business and those to third-party sellerson our online marketplace.As of December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and September 30, 2014, our accounts payable amounted to RMB3,636 million,RMB8,097 million, RMB11,019 million and RMB17,036 million (US$2,776 million), respectively.These increases reflected a significant growth in oursales volumes and scale of operations for our online direct sales business and the related increase in products sourced from our suppliers, as well as the growthin the scale of operations of our online marketplace.From late 2013, we started to provide supply chain financing to our suppliers of online direct salesbusiness.As of December 31, 2013 and September 30, 2014, the balances of financing we provided to our suppliers amounted to RMB0.1 billion andRMB1.4 billion (US$0.2 billion), respectively.Our accounts payable turnover days for our online direct sales business excluding the impact from supplychain financing were 35.3 days in 2011, 42.1 days in 2012, 38.8 days in 2013 and 41.6 days in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.Accountspayable turnover days for a given period are equal to average accounts payable balances at the beginning and the end of the period divided by total cost ofrevenues during the period and multiplied by the number of days during the period.Our net inventories have increased significantly in recent periods, from RMB2,764 million as of December 31, 2011 to RMB4,754 million as ofDecember 31, 2012, RMB6,386 million as of December 31, 2013 and RMB11,095 million (US$1,808 million) as of September 30, 2014.These increasesreflected the additional inventory required to support our substantially expanded sales volumes.Our inventory turnover days were 34.6 days in 2011,35.7 days in 2012, and 32.1 days in 2013 and 33.1 days in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.Inventory turnover days for a given period equalaverage inventory balances at the beginning and the end of the period divided by total101Table of Contentscost of revenues during the period and then multiplied by the number of days during the period.Our inventory balances will fluctuate over time due to anumber of factors, including expansion in our product selection and changes in our product mix.Our inventory balances typically increase when we preparefor special promotion events, such as the anniversary of the founding of our company on June 18 and China's new online shopping festival on November 11.Although we consolidate the results of our consolidated variable interest entities, we only have access to cash balances or future earnings of ourconsolidated variable interest entities through our contractual arrangements with them.See \"Corporate History and Structure.\"For restrictions and limitationson liquidity and capital resources as a result of our corporate structure, see \"—Holding Company Structure.\"As a Cayman Islands exempted company and offshore holding company, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to ourwholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China only through loans or capital contributions, subject to the approval of government authorities and limits on theamount of capital contributions and loans.In addition, our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China may provide Renminbi funding to their respectivesubsidiaries through capital contributions and entrusted loans, and to our consolidated variable interest entities only through entrusted loans.See \"RiskFactors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure—PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies andgovernmental control of currency conversion may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of our initial public offering to make loans to our PRCsubsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities or make additional capital contributions to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China, whichcould materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\"Renminbi may be converted into foreign exchange for current account items, including interest and trade- and service-related transactions.As aresult, our PRC subsidiaries and our consolidated variable interest entities in China may purchase foreign exchange for the payment of license, content orother royalty fees and expenses to offshore licensors and content partners, for example.Our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries may convert Renminbi amounts that they generate in their own business activities, including technicalconsulting and related service fees pursuant to their contracts with the consolidated variable interest entities, as well as dividends they receive from their ownsubsidiaries, into foreign exchange and pay them to their non-PRC parent companies in the form of dividends.However, current PRC regulations permit ourwholly foreign-owned subsidiaries to pay dividends to us only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accountingstandards and regulations.Each of our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits after making up previousyears' accumulated losses each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds until the total amount set aside reaches 50% of its registered capital.These reservesare not distributable as cash dividends.Furthermore, capital account transactions, which include foreign direct investment and loans, must be approved byand/or registered with SAFE and its local branches.102Table of Contents              The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:Operating

had capital commitments contracted in an aggregate amount of RMB912 million as of December 31,2013.These capital commitments primarily relate to commitments on construction of office buildings and warehouses, and are to be paid in the followingyears according to the construction progress.Holding Company Structure              JD.com, Inc. is a holding company with no material operations of its own.We conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries andconsolidated variable interest entities in China.As a result, JD.com, Inc.'s ability to pay dividends depends upon dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries.Ifour existing PRC subsidiaries or any newly formed ones incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict theirability to pay dividends to us.In addition, our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China are permitted to pay dividends to us only out of their retainedearnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations.Under PRC law, each of our subsidiaries and our consolidatedvariable interest entities in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds until suchreserve funds reach 50% of its registered capital.In addition, each of our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China may allocate a portion of its after-taxprofits based on PRC accounting standards to enterprise expansion fund and staff bonus and welfare fund at its discretion.Each of the other PRC subsidiariesand our consolidated variable interest entities may allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to a discretionary surplusfund at its discretion.The statutory reserve funds and the discretionary funds are not distributable as cash dividends.Remittance of dividends by a whollyforeign-owned company out of China is subject to examination by the banks designated by SAFE.As of September 30, 2014, the amount restricted,including paid-in capital and statutory reserve funds, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations, was approximatelyRMB13,996 million (US$2,280 million).Our PRC subsidiaries have never paid dividends and will not be able to pay dividends until they generateaccumulated profits and meet the requirements for statutory reserve funds.Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements              We have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties.We have notentered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholder's equity or that are not reflected in our consolidated financialstatements.Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity ormarket risk support to such entity.We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or creditsupport to us or engages in leasing, hedging or product development services with us.Inflation              Inflation in China has not affected our results of operations in recent years.According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the year-over-yearpercent changes in the consumer price index for December 2011, 2012 and 2013 and September 2014 were increases of 4.1%, 2.5%, 2.5% and 1.6%,106Table of Contentsrespectively.Although we have not been affected by inflation in the past, we may be affected if China experiences higher rates of inflation in the future.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market RiskForeign Exchange Risk              All of our revenues and substantially all of our expenses are denominated in Renminbi.We do not believe that we currently have any significantdirect foreign exchange risk and have not used any derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to such risk.Although in general our exposure toforeign exchange risks should be limited, the value of your investment in our ADSs will be affected by the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and theRenminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in Renminbi, while our ADSs will be traded in U.S. dollars.The conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is based on rates set by the People's Bank of China.The PRC governmentallowed the Renminbi to appreciate by more than 20% against the U.S. dollar between July 2005 and July 2008.Between July 2008 and June 2010, thisappreciation halted and the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band.Since June 2010, the PRC governmenthas allowed the Renminbi to appreciate slowly against the U.S. dollar again, and it has appreciated more than 10% since June 2010.It is difficult to predicthow market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future.To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would havean adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we receive from the conversion.Conversely, if we decide to convert Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose ofmaking payments for dividends on our ordinary shares or ADSs or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi wouldhave a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amounts available to us.As of September 30, 2014, we had RMB-denominated cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB17.6 billion, andU.S.dollar-denominated cash balances of US$3.0 billion.Assuming we had converted RMB17.6 billion into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate of RMB6.1380for US$1.00 as of September 30, 2014, our U.S. dollar cash balance would have been US$5.9 billion.If the RMB had depreciated by 10% against the U.S.dollar, our U.S. dollar cash balance would have been US$5.6 billion instead.Assuming we had converted US$3.0 billion into RMB at the exchange rate ofRMB6.1380 for US$1.00 as of September 30, 2014, our RMB cash balance would have been RMB36.3 billion.If the RMB had depreciated by 10% againstthe U.S. dollar, our RMB cash balance would have been RMB 38.3 billion instead.Interest Rate Risk              Our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to the interest income generated by excess cash, which is mostly held in interest-bearing bankdeposits.We have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.Interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk.Wehave not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in market interest rates.However, our future interest incomemay fall short of expectations due to changes in market interest rates.Critical Accounting Policies, Judgements and Estimates              An accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highlyuncertain at the time such estimate is made, and if different accounting estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting107Table of Contentsestimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements.We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions.We continuallyevaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experiences and various other assumptionsthat we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual resultscould differ from our expectations as a result of changes in our estimates.Some of our accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment than others intheir application and require us to make significant accounting estimates.The following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financialstatements and other disclosures included in this prospectus.When reviewing our financial statements, you should consider (i) our selection of criticalaccounting policies, (ii) the judgments and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and (iii) the sensitivity of reported results to changesin conditions and assumptions.Consolidation of Affiliated Entities              Foreign ownership of internet-based businesses is subject to significant restrictions under current PRC laws and regulations.The PRC governmentregulates internet access, the distribution of online information and the conduct of online commerce through strict business licensing requirements and othergovernment regulations.These laws and regulations also include limitations on foreign ownership in PRC companies that provide internet contentdistribution services.To comply with PRC laws and regulations, we conduct our operations in China through a series of contractual arrangements entered into between ourPRC subsidiary, Jingdong Century, our affiliated PRC entities, Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou and their shareholders.As a result of these contractualarrangements, we have the ability to direct the activities of Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou that most significantly impact their economic performance,and to obtain a majority of the residual returns of Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou.We are considered the primary beneficiary of these entities, andaccordingly these entities are our variable interest entities under U.S. GAAP and we consolidate the results in our consolidated financial statements.Anychanges in PRC laws and regulations that affect our ability to control these entities might preclude us from consolidating these entities in the future.Advertising Revenue              We provide advertising placements for a specified period of time on our various website channels and in various formats, including but not limited tobanners, links, logos, buttons, and content integration.We recognize advertising revenues ratably over the period during which the advertising services areprovided.Advertising arrangements involving multiple deliverables are allocated into single-element arrangements based on their relative selling price inthe absence of vendor specific objective evidence and third-party evidence, and the related revenue is recognized over the period during which the element isprovided.Significant assumptions and estimates have been made in estimating the relative selling price of each single-element, and changes in judgments onthese assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing of advertising revenue recognition.We did not enter into material advertising-for-advertising barter transactions, or any other types of barter transactions.Rebates and Subsidies              We periodically receive consideration from certain suppliers, representing rebates for products sold and subsidies for the sales of the suppliers'products over a period of time.The rebates are not sufficiently separable from our purchase of the suppliers' products and they do not represent a108Table of Contentsreimbursement of costs incurred by us to sell vendors' products.We account for the rebates received from our suppliers as a reduction to the price we pay forthe products purchased and therefore we record such amounts as a reduction of cost of revenues when recognized in our consolidated financial statements.Rebates are earned based on reaching minimum purchase thresholds for a specified period.When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated based on ourpast experiences and current forecasts, a portion of the rebate is recognized as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.Subsidies are calculatedbased on the volume of products sold through us and are recorded as a reduction of cost of revenues when the sales have been completed and the amount isdeterminable.Inventories              Inventories are primarily accounted for using the weighted average cost method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value.This valuationrequires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individualcustomers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category.These assumptions about futuredisposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future.Asa measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of September 30, 2014, we would have recorded an additional cost ofsales of approximately RMB110.9 million.Goodwill              We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying valuemay not be recoverable.Our annual testing date is December 31.We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fairvalue of the reporting units.If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not thatgoodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and thecarrying value.We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows.Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate offuture net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models.Changes in these forecastscould significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair valueassumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test, no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test.Asa measure of sensitivity, a 10% decrease in the fair value of our reporting units as of December 31, 2013 would have had no impact on the carrying value ofour goodwill.109Table of ContentsShare-Based CompensationNon-vested ordinary shares and restricted share units              The following table sets forth information regarding the non-vested ordinary shares and restricted share units granted to eligible employees and non-employee consultants:              Prior to our initial public offering, the fair value of the non-vested ordinary shares and restricted share units were assessed using the income approach/ discounted cash flow method, with a discount for lack of marketability given that the shares underlying the award were not publicly traded at the time ofgrant, and was determined partly in reliance on a valuation determined with the assistance of an independent valuation firm using our estimates andassumptions.This assessment required complex and subjective judgments regarding our projected financial and operating results, our unique business risks,the liquidity of our ordinary shares and our operating history and prospects at the time the grants were made.After our initial public offering, in determining the fair value of the non-vested ordinary shares and restricted share units granted, the closing marketprice of the underlying shares on the last trading date prior to the grant dates is applied.In determining the fair value of the non-vested ordinary shares andrestricted share units granted on May 22, 2014, the date when our ADSs first commenced trading on NASDAQ, the per share equivalent of our initial publicoffering price to the public is applied.Share options              The following table sets forth information regarding the share options granted to eligible employees:              Management is responsible for determining the fair value of options granted to employees and

value of our stock options, the binomial option pricing model was applied.The key assumptions used to determine the fairvalue of the options at the relevant grant dates in 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014 were as follows.Changes in these assumptions couldsignificantly affect the fair value of stock options and hence the amount of compensation expenses we recognize in our consolidated financial statements.Our share-based compensation expense is measured at the fair value of the awards as calculated under the Binomial option-pricing model.Assumptions used in the Binomial Model are presented below:              The assumptions used in share-based compensation expense recognition represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherentuncertainties and the application of our judgment.If factors change or different assumptions are used, the share-based compensation expense could bematerially different for any period.Moreover, the estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value that ultimately will berealized by grantees who receive share-based awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair valuemade by us for accounting purposes.Fair Value of Our Ordinary Shares              Prior to our initial public offering, we were a private company with no quoted market prices for our ordinary shares.We therefore needed to makeestimates of the fair value of our ordinary shares at various dates for the following purposes:•determining the fair value of our ordinary shares at the date of issuance of convertible instruments as one of the inputs into determining theintrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature, if any; and •determining the fair value of our ordinary shares at the date of the grant of a share-based compensation award to our employees or non-employees as one of the inputs into determining the grant date fair value of the award.111  2013 Nine Months EndedSeptember 31, 2014 Expected volatility(1)  47%~50%  53% Risk-free interest rate (per annum)(2)  1.83%~2.91%  3.50% Exercise multiples(3)  2.8  2.8 Expected

of our ordinary shares estimated at different times prior to our initial public offering with the assistancefrom an independent valuation firm:              In determining the fair value of our ordinary shares in 2011, 2012 and February 2013, we relied in part on a valuation retrospectively determined withthe assistance of an independent valuation firm based on data we provided.The valuation report provided us with guidelines in determining the fair value,but the determination was made by our management.We obtained a retrospective valuation instead of a contemporaneous valuation by an unrelatedvaluation specialist because, prior to December 2013, our financial and limited human resources were principally focused on our business developmentefforts.We applied the income approach/discounted cash flow analysis based on our projected cash flow using our best estimate as of the valuation date.Thedetermination of the fair value of our ordinary shares requires complex and subjective judgments to be made regarding our projected financial and operatingresults, our unique business risks, the liquidity of our shares and our operating history and prospects at the time of valuation.The major assumptions used in calculating the fair value of ordinary shares include:              Discount rates.The discount rates listed out in the table above were based on the weighted average cost of capital, which was determined based ona consideration of the factors including risk-free rate, comparative industry risk, equity risk premium, company size and non-systemic risk factors.Comparable companies.In deriving the weighted average cost of capital used as the discount rates under the income approach, seven publiclytraded companies were selected for reference as our guideline companies.The guideline companies were selected based on the following criteria: (i) theyoperate in the e-commerce industry and (ii) their shares are publicly traded in developed capital markets, including the United States, the UK and Japan.Discount for lack of marketability, or DLOM.DLOM was quantified by the Black-Scholes option pricing model.Under this option-pricing method,the cost of the put option, which can hedge the price change before the privately held shares can be sold, was considered as a basis to determine the DLOM.This option pricing method is one of the methods commonly used in estimating DLOM as it can take into consideration factors like timing of a liquidityevent (such as an IPO) and estimated volatility of our shares.The farther the valuation date is from an expected liquidity event, the higher the put optionvalue and thus the higher the implied DLOM.The lower DLOM is used for the valuation, the higher is the determined fair value of the ordinary shares.The income approach involves applying appropriate discount rates to estimated cash flows that are based on earnings forecasts.Our revenues andearnings growth rates, as well as major milestones that we have achieved, contributed to the increase in the fair value of our ordinary shares.However, thesefair values are inherently uncertain and highly subjective.The assumptions used in deriving the fair values are consistent with our business plan.Theseassumptions include: no material changes in the existing political, legal and economic conditions in China; our ability to retain competent management,112Date Equity Value Fair Valueper Share DLOM DiscountRate Type ofValuation  (US$ thousands) (US$)      May 15, 2011  5,470,769  3.42  20%  19% RetrospectiveJuly 15, 2012  6,822,739  3.67

operations; and no material deviation in market conditions from economic forecasts.These assumptions areinherently uncertain.The option-pricing method was used to allocate enterprise value to preferred and ordinary shares, taking into account the guidance prescribed by theAICPA Audit and Accounting Practice Aid, \"Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.\"The method treats commonstock and preferred stock as call options on the enterprise's value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preference of the preferred stock.The option-pricing method involves making estimates of the anticipated timing of a potential liquidity event, such as a sale of our company or aninitial public offering, and estimates of the volatility of our equity securities.The anticipated timing is based on the plans of our board of directors andmanagement.Estimating the volatility of the share price of a privately held company is complex because there is no readily available market for the shares.We estimated the volatility of our shares to range from 35.7% to 48.8% based on the historical volatilities of comparable publicly traded companies engagedin similar lines of business.Had we used different estimates of volatility, the allocations between preferred and ordinary shares would have been different.The fair value of our ordinary shares increased from US$3.42 as of May 15, 2011 to US$3.67 as of July 15, 2012.The increase in fair value of ourordinary shares was attributable to organic growth of our business.The fair value of our ordinary shares increased slightly from July 15, 2012 to February 2, 2013.DLOM decreased from 20% to 15% during the sameperiod, primarily due to our expectations for the timing of our initial public offering and the improved capital market sentiment in the United States.Theeffect of the decrease in DLOM was offset by our lower estimate of revenues because of the slowdown of China economic growth rate.The fair value of our ordinary shares increased from US$3.70 as of February 2, 2013 to US$3.96 as of December 20, 2013.The increase in fair value ofour ordinary shares was primarily attributable to both the organic growth of our business and the decrease of DLOM from 15% to 10%.The decrease ofDLOM was primarily due to our expectations for the timing of our initial public offering and the improved capital market sentiment in the United States.The fair value of our ordinary shares increased from US$3.96 as of December 20, 2013 to US$6.33 as of March 31, 2014.We believe the increase inthe fair value of our ordinary shares was primarily attributable to the fact that on March 10, 2014, we entered into a strategic cooperation agreement withTencent and a series of agreements to acquire the Paipai and QQ Wanggou marketplace businesses, equity interests in Shanghai Icson and other intangibleassets.We believe that this transaction will further extend our presence in the China e-commerce market and create synergies through economies of scales.Inview of the above, we adjusted our financial forecast to reflect the expected economic benefits and synergistic of this transaction.We also lowered thediscount rate from 19.0% as of December 20, 2013 to 17.5% as of March 31, 2014 due to the increase in the size of our business and the reduction inperceived uncertainties associated with our business plan.Income Taxes              Current income taxes are provided on the basis of net income for financial reporting purposes, adjusted for income and expense items which are notassessable or deductible for income tax purposes, in accordance with the regulations of the relevant tax jurisdictions.We follow the liability method ofaccounting for income taxes.Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financialstatements carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities by applying enacted statutory tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which thetemporary differences are expected to reverse.We record a valuation allowance to offset deferred113Table of Contentstax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.Theeffect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rate is recognized in our consolidated financial statements in the period of change.In accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, we recognize in our financial statements the benefit of a tax position if the tax position is \"more likelythan not\" to prevail based on the facts and technical merits of the position.Tax positions that meet the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold aremeasured at the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement.We estimate our liability forunrecognized tax benefits which are periodically assessed and may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, changes and/ordevelopments with respect to tax audits, and expiration of the statute of limitations.The ultimate outcome for a particular tax position may not be determinedwith certainty prior to the conclusion of a tax audit and, in some cases, appeal or litigation process.The actual benefits ultimately realized may differ fromour estimates.As each audit is concluded, adjustments, if any, are recorded in our financial statements in the period in which the audit is concluded.Additionally, in future periods, changes in facts, circumstances and new information may require us to adjust the recognition and measurement estimates withregard to individual tax positions.Changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recognized in the period in which the changes occur.As ofDecember 31, 2011, 2012, 2013 and September 30, 2014, we did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions.Recent Accounting Pronouncements              In July 2012, the FASB issued revised guidance on \"Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.\"The revised guidance provides anentity the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not thatan indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, an entity concludes that it is not more likely thannot that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action.However, if an entity concludes otherwise, thenit is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform a quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value withthe carrying amount in accordance with U.S.GAAP.The revised guidance is effective for us for annual and interim impairment tests performed for the fiscalyear beginning on January 1, 2013.This amendment will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.In February 2013, the FASB issued revised guidance on \"Comprehensive Income: Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated OtherComprehensive Income.\"The revised guidance does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income infinancial statements.However, the revised guidance requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated othercomprehensive income by component.In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in thenotes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amountreclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period.For other amounts that are not requiredunder U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP thatprovide additional detail about those amounts.The revised guidance is effective prospectively for us for the reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2013.The revised guidance will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, \"Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar TaxLoss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists\", which is an update to provide guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax114Table of Contentsbenefit when a net operating loss carryforward exists.The guidance requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as areduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, except for when a net operating loss carryforward is not available as of the reportingdate to settle taxes that would result from the disallowance of the tax position or when the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for purposes ofreducing the net operating loss carry forward.The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013 and for interim periods within thatfiscal year.We do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in\"Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)\", and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount thatreflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reportingperiods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting

China's Retail Industry              China's retail industry is characterized by rapid growth and high fragmentation, as described below.Rapid Growth              China's retail industry has experienced substantial growth as a result of rising disposable income and increasing urbanization.According to theNational Bureau of Statistics of China, the annual per capita disposable income of urban households in China grew from RMB15,781 in 2008 to RMB26,955(US$4,409) in 2013, representing a CAGR of 11.3%.According to the World Bank research report \"China 2030\", China is undergoing structural transitions characterized by a higher share of consumptionand service in the economy and a lower share of exports, savings and investment.Consumption as a percentage of GDP is expected to increase from 56%during the period 2011-2015 to 66% during the period 2026-2030 with a corresponding decline in investment as a percentage of GDP.Retail sales areexpected to continue growing rapidly.High Fragmentation              China's large size and population and differences in consumer behavior and purchasing power across the country have made it a highly complex anddiverse retail market.Modern retail formats, including hypermarkets, department stores, specialty retailers and convenience stores, have emerged and becomethe mainstream distribution channels in more developed cities.However, traditional retail remains the dominant retail channel in less developed areas, andcompanies must work with a huge number of small, independent outlets through a network of third-party agents, distributors and local wholesalers to reachconsumers in those areas, which can be difficult to manage.Such a retail environment presents significant challenges for retailers to scale up and expandnationwide.As a result, China's retail industry is highly fragmented, with the top 20 retailers in aggregate only accounting for approximately 12% of the totalmarket share in 2013, according to Euromonitor International.In contrast, the equivalent figure in the United States is around 40%, according to the samesource.The inability of large offline retailers to gain significant nationwide market share, together with the expected growth of retail sales in China, presentsan opportunity to online retail companies.China's Online Retail MarketMarket Overview              According to iResearch, China's online retail market size measured by transaction volume was RMB1,892 billion in 2013 and is expected to reachRMB5,634 billion (US$922 billion) in 2017, representing a CAGR of 31.4%, a growth rate significantly faster than that of total retail sales.China's onlineretail market transaction volume is also expected to have surpassed that of the United States in 2013.Despite the huge size of the market, China's online retailpenetration of internet users is still relatively low compared to that for the United States.iResearch expects that China's online retail penetration could furtherincrease to 54.1% by 2017.Market Trends              Growing internet use among mainstream consumers.The profile of Chinese internet users has been evolving as the demographic becomes botholder and wealthier.According to the China Internet Network Information Center, or CNNIC, internet users above the age of 30 increased from 27.9% in 2006to 43.0% in 2013 of the total online population, while those with an average monthly income above RMB3,000 increased from 13.9% in 2006 to 28.6%in 2013.116Table of Contents              Growing consumer focus on product quality and services.Product quality has become increasingly important to online shoppers in making theirpurchase decisions.According to a study of Chinese online shoppers conducted by iResearch in 2013, 38.0% of online shoppers indicated product quality asan important factor considered when shopping online, and 39.3% of online shoppers view brand credibility as an important factor considered when shoppingonline.Significant investment into logistics system.China's logistics infrastructure lags behind that found in more developed markets.The quality ofcustomer service from third-party service providers is inconsistent, in particular when seasonal spikes in demand put extra pressure on the logisticsinfrastructure, such as immediately following the annual November 11 online shopping spree.Because online retailers risk being held responsible bycustomers for failures in delivery service, major Chinese e-commerce players have been investing in building their own logistics networks to ensure aconsistent customer experience from ordering all the way through delivery.Rise of mobile shopping.With the rapid adoption of smartphones and tablets, as well as the development of 3G, 4G and LTE networks and wifiservices, mobile shopping has become an increasingly important driver for online retail in China.Mobile shopping increases the time people spend on onlineshopping by allowing them to shop anytime anywhere.Mobile shoppers generally make purchases through applications they download to their mobiledevices, which increases customer stickiness, facilitates targeted marketing and also enables push features, all of which tend to reduce marketing costs.According to iResearch, mobile shopping transaction value in China reached RMB274.0 billion (US$44.8 billion) in 2013, an increase of 297% over 2012,and reached RMB231.0 billion (US$37.6 billion) in the third quarter of 2014, an increase of 250.8% over the third quarter of 2013.Mobile shoppingpenetration increased from 14.5% in 2013 to 33.4% in the third quarter of 2014 and is expected to further increase to 56.9% by 2017, according to iResearch.Further penetration into smaller cities.While coastal provinces such as Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang rank at the top in terms of online retailorder volume, less affluent inland provinces demonstrated faster growth.Ningxia, Qinghai and Guizhou are the top three provinces in terms of online retailorder growth in 2012, according to iResearch.Urban disposable income is rising more rapidly in inland provinces than in coastal ones, according to theNational Bureau of Statistics, but physical retail access is less developed, which limits offline retail product selection.As more convenient payment solutionsand more developed logistics systems increasingly extend beyond large and developed cities, it is expected that demand for online retail from consumers inthe smaller and less developed cities of inland provinces will be strong in the future.Increasing variety of payment options.Payment-on-delivery remains a common payment method for Chinese shoppers when they purchase goodsonline.As debit and credit cards become increasingly common, online retail companies have started to include debit and credit cards in their payment-on-delivery options by using mobile POS machines.Online retail companies also offer diversified online payment options.Fulfillment Challenges              Despite the rapid growth of the online retail market, fulfillment remains a challenge for online retailers attempting to reach more consumers in moreareas while maintaining or improving the quality and efficiency of their service offerings.The fulfillment infrastructure in China is underdeveloped, in termsof both warehousing and logistics facilities and last-mile delivery services.Facilities.The substantial growth of China's retail industry, particularly the online retail market, has generated significant demand for warehousingand logistics facilities.However, modern facilities that meet the requirements of modern logistics operations for guaranteed storage safety, optimal andflexible space utilization and high operational efficiency are still in short supply.A handful117Table of Contentsof large cities, such as Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Tianjin, are home to a large portion of the modern facilities.In other cities, warehousingis predominately traditional wholesale warehouse space.According to CB Richard Ellis, an international commercial real estate services company, China'stotal gross floor area of commercial warehouse stock was approximately 698 million square meters as of 2012.In addition, CB Richard Ellis estimates that thetotal stock of modern logistics facilities is only approximately 13 million square meters in China in 2013, a figure that is disproportionately low for a nationof 1.3 billion people.Last-mile delivery.Historically, China's courier service industry has mainly served business-to-business delivery needs, and the state-owned postalservice has been the major last-mile delivery option for deliveries to consumers.With the rise of the online retail market, more consumer-oriented courierservice players have emerged and grown rapidly.However, few of them are able to offer the breadth of services demanded by online retail companies at areasonable price with extensive geographical coverage.Thus far in China, large delivery networks have typically expanded their coverage throughfranchising or subcontracting models, usually without many value-added services.On the other hand, regionally focused players who offer value-addedservices do not have a nationwide network and are not able to provide customized delivery service.The relative scarcity of large-scale, high-quality courierservice providers often means problems for online retail companies, including late deliveries, damaged and lost parcels, slow remittance of cash, poor returnprocedures, and limited special service offerings such as payment-on-delivery, installation or (in the case of apparel) product try-on.Online Retail Business Models in China              Online direct sales and online marketplace are the two major online retail business models in China.Under the online direct sales business model, a company procures and manages its own inventories, sells products directly to consumers online, andprovides delivery and after-sales services.Online direct sales companies generate revenues from the sale of products and incur the cost of procuring theproducts they sell.Online marketplaces are platforms that facilitate transactions between merchants and consumers and collect commission fees from sellers.Some alsoprovide fulfillment, delivery and other value-added services for merchants for an additional fee.A marketplace can either be operated by an independentthird party or by a company that also has its own online direct sales business.China's online retail market was originally dominated by online marketplaces, particularly independent online marketplaces.By aggregatingsignificant numbers of small and mid-sized merchants, online marketplaces offer a diversified merchandise selection that appeal to consumers.However, asconsumers shop online more frequently, they have become more sophisticated and increasingly demand better quality and service.E-commerce companiesoperating under the online direct sales model, with strictly managed procurement and fulfillment services and offering consumers a reliable source forauthentic products, have also been successful in the past several years, particularly as customers increasingly value product authenticity and better service.Meanwhile, large online direct sales companies have also started establishing their own online marketplaces for third-party sellers, increasing productofferings, monetizing online traffic and leveraging their fulfillment capabilities.We see growth potential in both business models going forward.We believe that what differentiates a successful player in China's online retail marketis the value that it can provide to consumers, at the core of which, we believe, are product, price and service.118Table of ContentsBUSINESS Overview              We are the largest online direct sales company in China in terms of transaction volume in the third quarter of 2014, with a market share in China of51.9%, according to iResearch.Our GMV increased from RMB32.7 billion in 2011 to RMB73.3 billion in 2012 and RMB125.5 billion (US$20.7 billion) in2013, and further to RMB213.5 billion (US$34.8 billion) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.We believe we provide consumers an enjoyable online retail experience.Through our content-rich and user-friendly website www.jd.com and mobileapplications, we offer a wide selection of authentic products at competitive prices which are delivered in a speedy and reliable manner.We also offerconvenient online and in-person payment options and comprehensive customer services.In order to have better control over fulfillment and to ensurecustomer satisfaction, we have built our own nationwide fulfillment infrastructure and last-mile delivery network, staffed by our own employees, whichsupports both our online direct sales and our online marketplace businesses.We have established strong relationships with our suppliers as we develop ouronline direct sales business.Leveraging our strengths, we launched our online marketplace business in 2010, which has allowed us to significantly expandour selection of products and services.As a result of our superior customer experience, our business has grown rapidly.As a result of the rapid growth of the number of products we offerthrough online direct sales and marketplace, electronic products and home appliances accounted for 80.1%, 65.3%, 63.6% and 56.9% of our total GMV in2011, 2012, 2013 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, respectively, and general merchandise and others for 19.9%, 34.7%, 36.4% and 43.1%.We foster an interactive user community that discusses, rates and reviews our products and services.We believe we have the largest online productreview database of any online direct sales company in China with approximately 426 million product reviews generated by our customers to date.We had12.5 million, 29.3 million, 47.4 million and 82.8 million active customer accounts and fulfilled approximately 65.9 million, 193.8 million, 323.3 million and582.9 million orders in 2011, 2012, 2013 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, respectively.Timely and reliable fulfillment is critical to the success of an online retail business.Given the underdevelopment of third-party fulfillment services inChina in terms of both warehousing and logistics facilities and last-mile delivery services, we made a strategic decision in 2007 to build and operate our ownnationwide fulfillment infrastructure.We believe we have the largest fulfillment infrastructure of any e-commerce company in China.We operated118 warehouses with an aggregate gross floor area of approximately 2.3 million square meters in 39 cities and 2,045 delivery stations and 1,045 pickupstations in 1,855 counties and districts across China as of September 30, 2014, and had 31,063 delivery personnel, 11,530 warehouse staff and7,673 customer service personnel as of the same date.Leveraging this nationwide fulfillment infrastructure, we deliver a majority of the orders directly tocustomers ourselves, over 80% of which were delivered on the day the order was placed or the day after.As of September 30, 2014, we provided same-daydelivery in 130 counties and districts under our 211 program and next-day delivery in another 815 counties and districts across China.We are a technology-driven company and have invested heavily in developing our own highly scalable proprietary technology platform thatsupports our rapid growth and enables us to provide value-added technology services.In addition, our sophisticated business intelligence system enables usto refine our merchandise sourcing strategy to manage our inventory turnover and control costs and to leverage our large customer database to createcustomized product recommendations and cost-effective and targeted advertising.119Table of Contents              We introduced an online marketplace to leverage our brand recognition, large and growing customer base, extensive transaction data, fulfillmentinfrastructure and proprietary technology platform.Our online marketplace allows us to provide customers a much greater selection of products.Our onlinedirect sales and marketplace businesses together made us the second largest B2C e-commerce company in China, with a 19.3% market share based ontransaction volume in the third quarter of 2014, according to iResearch.We attract and select third-party sellers to offer authentic products to our customersthrough our online marketplace.We monitor third-party sellers' performance and activities on our online marketplace closely to ensure that they meet ourrequirements for authentic products and high-quality customer service.In addition to basic transaction processing and billing services, we offer third-partysellers a suite of value-added fulfillment and other services.Our business has grown substantially in recent years.Our total net revenues increased from RMB21.1 billion in 2011 to RMB41.4 billion in 2012and RMB69.3 billion (US$11.5 billion) in 2013, and increased from RMB49.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to RMB80.3 billion(US$13.1 billion) for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.We had net losses of RMB1.3 billion, RMB1.7 billion, RMB0.05 billion (US$8 million)and RMB4,5 billion (US$0.7 billion) in 2011, 2012, 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively.Core Philosophy              Our core philosophy to put customers always as our top priority can be illustrated by the following:•Our team is the foundation of our company.We have built a strong and dedicated team and made significant efforts in hiring, training andretaining our workforce.•To support our anticipated growth, we have developed a platform of comprehensive IT, logistics and financial systems to manage our flow ofproducts, services, information and finances.•Our data-driven management employs an array of key performance indicators to minimize costs and maximize efficiency in our operations.•As a result, we are able to offer a broad selection of authentic products at competitive prices with comprehensive services.We strive to create acompelling online shopping experience that generates customer loyalty.120Table of ContentsCompetitive Strengths              We believe that the following competitive strengths contribute to our success and differentiate us from our competitors:China's Largest Online Direct Sales Company              We are the largest online direct sales company in China in terms of transaction volume in the third quarter of 2014, with a market share in China of51.9%, according to iResearch.We had 12.5 million, 29.3 million, 47.4 million and 82.8 million active customer accounts and fulfilled approximately65.9 million, 193.8 million, 323.3 million and 582.9 million orders in 2011, 2012, 2013 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, respectively.OurGMV increased from RMB32.7 billion in 2011 to RMB73.3 billion in 2012 and RMB125.5 billion (US$20.7 billion) in 2013, and further toRMB213.5 billion (US$34.8 billion) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.We believe that scale and market leading position are critical to success in the online retail market in China and can provide important competitiveadvantages to us.Our scale allows us to offer a wide selection of authentic products at competitive prices, secure favorable terms from our suppliers andattract more third-party sellers to our online marketplace.The resulting customer base and order volume have enabled us to create a large and growingcustomer database that we can leverage to improve our inventory management, merchandising strategy and targeted marketing efforts.Through access tocertain of Tencent's e-commerce and mobile users through our recent strategic cooperation agreement, we believe this further expands our customer reach,which in turn further enhances our targeted marketing efforts.Our in-depth knowledge of customer behavior and preferences has in turn helped us to expandinto new product categories and introduce new products successfully.Our growing customer base has also generated a large volume of customer ratings,product reviews and comments that helps drive orders, increase customer stickiness and improve our merchandising.We believe we have the largest onlineproduct review database of any online direct sales company in China with approximately 426 million product reviews generated by our customers to date.Furthermore, as we reach a critical mass of customers and orders, it becomes more cost efficient for us to rely primarily on our own fulfillment infrastructure.Our Superior Customer Experience              Customers are our top priority.We believe that product, price and service are fundamental to a compelling online shopping experience.To this end,we offer a wide selection of authentic goods at competitive prices.Our slogan is \"  \" (selection, speed, quality, value).Our www.jd.com websiteand mobile applications contain comprehensive product information and reviews and helpful recommendations, and we have fostered an active customercommunity by encouraging our customers to rate and review products and interact with each other on our discussion boards.By directly operating our ownlast-mile delivery network covering the majority of our customers, we are able to provide speedy and reliable delivery, convenient in-person payment optionsand comprehensive after-sales services, thereby maintaining greater control over customer experience.We have a growing and loyal active customer base.Over the years, our customers have shown loyalty to us through their increased activity levels.For example, those customer accounts that were active in 2008increased their average number of purchases each year thereafter, from approximately 3.7 in 2008 to 4.4 in 2009, 6.2 in 2010, 10.7 in 2011, 14.9 in 2012 and16.6 in 2013.Our Own Nationwide Fulfillment Infrastructure              We believe we have the largest fulfillment infrastructure among all e-commerce companies in China, including 118 warehouses with an aggregategross floor area of approximately 2.3 million square meters in 39 cities, plus 2,045 delivery stations and 1,045 pickup stations in 1,855 counties and districts121Table of Contentsacross China, with a total of 31,603 delivery personnel as of September 30, 2014.We made a strategic decision to set up and operate our own nationwidefulfillment infrastructure to ensure timely and reliable delivery to our customers and maintain greater control over customer experience.With the addition ofdelivery staff from Tencent, our nationwide fulfillment coverage has been further enhanced.We have also built and opened a new highly automatedfulfillment center in Shanghai in October 2014.We believe that this allows us to address the underdevelopment of third-party fulfillment services in China interms of both warehousing and logistics facilities and last-mile delivery services.Our nationwide fulfillment infrastructure currently allows us to providesame-day delivery in 130 counties and districts under our 211 program and next-day delivery in another 815 counties and districts across China as ofSeptember 30, 2014.We have built our own delivery network to cover those areas where we have a critical mass of customers and sufficient orders to justify theexpenditures required, and we expect this will help us reduce our fulfillment expenses over time as our order volume and order density in those areas increase.Operating our own fulfillment infrastructure also allows us to continue fulfilling orders during peak holiday seasons.Besides serving our online direct salesbusiness, our fulfillment infrastructure also supports the growth of our online marketplace.We offer complete fulfillment support and services to our third-party sellers, which adds significant value to them and encourages them to integrate their operations more closely with ours.We believe that this provides astrong inducement for third-party sellers to remain on our platform and clearly differentiates us from our competitors.Our Strong Merchandise Sourcing Capabilities              We have established an extensive network of suppliers and third-party sellers for our business.As we have grown rapidly and expanded our productcategories and product selection aggressively, we have substantially increased the number of suppliers for our online direct sales from approximately 2,700as of December 31, 2011 to 4,600 as of December 31, 2012 to 6,000 as of December 31, 2013 and further to 6,400 as of September 30, 2014.Our onlinemarketplace has also attracted a large number of third-party sellers since its launch in October 2010.The third-party sellers on our online marketplace haveincreased from approximately 2,300 as of December 31, 2011 to 13,300 as of December 31, 2012 to 23,500 as of December 31, 2013 and further to over50,000 as of September 30, 2014.With our extensive network of suppliers and third-party sellers, we are able to obtain a wide selection of merchandise atfavorable terms.We also leverage our market position to gain exclusive rights to sell certain popular products in China.For example, we were authorized inJuly 2013 to sell LG-D802 WCDMA mobile phones on an exclusive basis in China for a one-year period, and since we started reselling Lenovo productsonline in 2008, we have been authorized to sell many of Lenovo's new products as its exclusive online retailer in China for a certain period of time followingtheir launch.Moreover, we started to procure a large proportion of merchandise directly from suppliers instead of agents as our sales continue to increase,which could help improve our margins further.Leveraging our extensive network of suppliers and our insights into their business operations, we havedeveloped various financial products, including supply chain financing, as an additional value-added service we provide to our suppliers.We believe that weprovide significant value to our suppliers, and that our value proposition helps us to obtain competitive prices and favorable terms from our suppliers.Our Highly Scalable Proprietary Technology Platform              We are a technology-driven company and have invested heavily since inception in developing our own robust, scalable and service-orientedtechnology platform.This platform enables us to accurately process and fulfill increasingly large numbers of orders at peak periods while maintainingprocessing speed and quality consistency, as well as powering full supply chain visibility and control.We have developed a sophisticated businessintelligence system that leverages our large customer database to create customized product recommendations to support push and targeted marketing,allowing us to122Table of Contentsefficiently attract new customers as well as new purchases from existing customers.We also leverage our large customer database to produce our salesforecast, which we use to adjust our procurement strategy to minimize excess inventory risks and enhance relationships with suppliers.We have a large andexperienced IT team to design, develop, and operate our technology platform.Our Fast Growing Online Marketplace              To provide one-stop shopping that meets consumers' everyday shopping needs, we have established and rapidly expanded our online marketplace tooffer a wide selection of products to complement our online direct sales products.As of September 30, 2014, there were over 50,000 third-party sellers overour online marketplace.The GMV for our online marketplace was RMB2.9 billion, RMB16.6 billion, RMB31.8 billion (US$5.3 billion) andRMB75.2 billion (US$12.3 billion) in 2011, 2012, 2013 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, respectively.Our nationwide market reach andlarge customer base offer third-party sellers an effective distribution channel, and by requiring third-party sellers to meet our standards for authenticity,reliability and customer service and allowing them to use our warehousing and delivery services, we strive to give customers the same high quality onlineshopping experience regardless of the source of the products they choose.We re-launched Paipai's C2C marketplace in July 2014 following our acquisitionof the business from Tencent in March 2014.The enhanced platform is dedicated to providing consumers with increased selection of long-tail products.Theaddition of Paipai marketplace enhances our ability to attract third-party sellers and in particular cultivate smaller third-party sellers that are more suitable forC2C selling through Paipai but may develop over time into being suitable for B2C selling.We collect commissions from sales on our online marketplace andalso offer additional value-added services to our third-party sellers, including data mining and analytics capability to provide them with customer and marketinsights that support them in product planning and in conducting targeted promotional and marketing activities.We believe that the combination of ouronline direct sales and online marketplace business with our own nationwide fulfillment infrastructure makes us an uniquely strong player in China's onlineretail industry.Our Visionary Founder, Experienced Management Team and Strong Corporate Culture              Our founder, chairman and chief executive officer Richard Qiangdong Liu is a highly recognized entrepreneur and a pioneer in the e-commerce andonline retail industry in China.Under Mr. Liu's leadership, we have introduced many innovative initiatives such as establishing and operating our ownnationwide fulfillment infrastructure.In December 2011, Mr. Liu

position and our employee training, career development and incentive programs, have contributed greatly to motivatingand retaining our talented employees.Our Strategies              Our goal is to become the largest e-commerce company in the world.We plan to achieve this goal by implementing strategies to optimize customerexperience, deepen our market penetration and123Table of Contentsenhance our brand recognition while continuing to improve our margins and operating leverage.These strategies include:Attract New Customers and Cultivate Customer Loyalty              We intend to attract new customers and cultivate customer loyalty through further innovations and improvements to our customers' shoppingexperience.We will continue to refine our business intelligence system to provide more effective targeted recommendations to attract new purchases fromexisting customers.We also plan to further expand our reach into smaller cities by setting up and operating more of our own warehousing and logisticsfacilities and last-mile delivery services to customers in those cities.In addition, we will continue to provide top-notch customer service by increasing ourcustomer service support personnel, expanding our after-sales maintenance, replacement and repair services and adding new customer service channels.Wealso intend to engage in brand promotion campaigns and other marketing activities to enhance our brand recognition throughout China, especially in smallercities where we expect to attract more customers and increase sales.As we expect customers will increasingly purchase goods and services from their mobile devices, we plan to further strengthen our mobile internetpresence to seize the promising market opportunities.Approximately 29.6% of our orders fulfilled were placed through our mobile applications in the thirdquarter of 2014, as compared to approximately 9.8% in the third quarter of 2013.We plan to develop and introduce more mobile applications and frequentlyupgrade existing applications to enhance our mobile user experience and engagement.We also plan to make our applications available on more mobiledevices and adapt the layout and appearance of our product pages to ensure that mobile users can conveniently access all of the rich content that they areaccustomed to seeing when they visit our website.In addition, we intend to further expand the functionality of our mobile applications to incorporateadditional features, such as location-based services and payment functions, to enable our customers to complete transactions on mobile conveniently andreliably.We may also pursue opportunities to cooperate with other key players in the mobile internet industry to expand our service offerings.We andTencent formed a strategic partnership, whereby Tencent agrees to offer us prominent level 1 access points in its mobile applications Weixin and Mobile QQand provide us internet traffic and other support from other key platforms of Tencent.We launched level 1 access on Tencent's Weixin platform for selectedWeixin users in Beijing and Shanghai first in May 2014 and subsequently rolled it out to all Weixin users in June 2014, and we also launched direct accesson Tencent's Mobile QQ in August 2014.We expect to enrich our customers' mobile internet experience and reach Tencent's large mobile and internet userbase and further expand our presence on mobile internet through this strategic partnership.Further Expand Our Product Offerings              We plan to further expand our product offerings to provide one-stop shopping that meets consumers' everyday shopping needs.We plan to leverageour cooperation with Tencent in deepening our understanding of mobile as well as social commerce and expanding our product offerings accordingly.Webelieve that expanding our product offerings will help enhance customer experience, diversify our revenue sources and further improve our economies ofscale.In general, we will focus on providing even greater product selection within our already extensive general merchandise product categories.Inparticular, we plan to expand our offerings of private label products and services and virtual goods.We have also launched our mobile virtual networkoperator business, essentially resale of mobile telecommunication services.A key element of our product strategy is to continue to expand our onlinemarketplace, with a focus on expanding product selection to complement our online direct sales products.We plan to attract additional third-party sellers tooffer more products on our online marketplace while maintaining our standards for authentic products and customer service.124Table of ContentsEnhance Our Fulfillment Infrastructure              We plan to enhance our fulfillment infrastructure by building new warehouses and establishing more delivery stations to expand our ability to fulfillorders by ourselves, including in smaller and less developed cities across China as our business grows.The large-scale pick-and-pack operations supportingan online retail business require purpose-built and automated facilities in order to achieve maximum efficiency.Expanding the total gross floor area of ourwarehouses will allow us to improve their configuration and workflow and in particular to reduce order splitting, the practice of making multiple deliveriesper order, by concentrating more products within a single warehouse complex.The expansion of our fulfillment infrastructure also supports our fast-growingonline marketplace, which we believe not only improves our customers' shopping experience but also can leverage our established infrastructure and increasethe return on our investments.We plan to expand our nationwide fulfillment network by leasing or purchasing additional facilities across China over the next several years.As ofSeptember 30, 2014, we had land use rights in six cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shenyang and Kunshan, to build our ownwarehouses.In October 2014, we launched the initial phase of our new fulfillment center in Shanghai, comprising a total floor space of approximately100,000 square meters.New fulfillment centers in Guangzhou and Shenyang are under construction, and will have an aggregate gross floor area ofapproximately 268,000 square meters.We expect to put these fulfillment centers into operation in 2015.Strengthen Our Technology Platform              We will continue to develop our business intelligence system to effectively utilize the huge amount of transaction,

revenues fromhigher-margin products by further increasing revenue contribution from commissions and fees for services.We plan to substantially increase revenues fromour online marketplace by attracting more third-party sellers to sell products on our website and providing value-added services to them, such as125Table of Contentswarehousing and delivery services.We also plan to offer cloud-based software-as-a-service to our third-party sellers and other e-commerce businesses as wellas offering enhanced information and data analytic services after we deploy the new large-scale data platform that we are currently developing.In addition,we intend to monetize the traffic on our website by providing advertising services.We recently launched a proprietary online marketing technology

continuing our significant revenue growth.We have expanded substantially in the past few years in order to gain wallet share in the fast growing online retail market in China.Going forward,we plan to continue our growth momentum and focus on improving our operating leverage concurrently.To this end, we intend to further leverage ourtechnology platform to enhance our operating processes and efficiency.Explore New Business Initiatives to Broaden Our Service Offerings              We are exploring new business initiatives to broaden our service offerings.These initiatives include:•Online-to-offline, or O2O solutions—We believe we are well positioned to provide O2O solutions to customers and offline retailers in selectlocations in China by capitalizing on our strong online presence and our established nationwide fulfillment infrastructure.We have startedcooperating with some local retail chains, convenience stores and hypermarkets in a number of cities to offer their products on our website anddeliver their products to our customers on a trial basis.•Internet finance—The scale of our business provides us with a promising opportunity to become an active participant in the emerging internetfinance sector in China.We have developed various financial products, including supply chain financing, as an additional value-addedservice we provide to our suppliers and third-party sellers on our online marketplace, and consumer financing.We will continue to developinnovative financial products that can further leverage our strengths in online retail and our technology platform, and we have also launchedour own online payment platform.•Consumer-to-consumer, or C2C—In July 2014, we re-launched Paipai, the C2C marketplace we acquired from Tencent in March 2014.Weintend to invest significant resources in expanding Paipai's C2C marketplace.We believe that this C2C business complements our existingdirect sales and online marketplace business.We plan to leverage our nationwide fulfillment infrastructure in expanding our C2C business.•International expansion—Leveraging our extensive experience in China, we may pursue strategic initiatives to expand our business overseas,including by setting up websites, warehouses and payment systems outside of China and promoting our JD brand to new overseas customers.Our Business Model              Since founding our company, we have focused on developing our online direct sales business as well as building our own fulfillment infrastructure,including last mile delivery capability, and our proprietary technology platform to support our operations.As our online direct sales business grewsubstantially in size, we launched our online marketplace to complement it to expand our product offerings, leverage our established fulfillmentinfrastructure and technology platform and ensure superior customer experience.We believe that the combination of our online direct sales and onlinemarketplace with our own nationwide fulfillment infrastructure and technology platform makes us an126Table of Contentsuniquely strong player in China's online retail industry in terms of providing superior customer experience.Leveraging the significant scale of our business, we have also begun to offer other services that are complementary to our core business, createsignificant value to our business partners, including third-party sellers and suppliers, and ultimately benefit our business and customers.Online Direct Sales              In our online direct sales business, we acquire products from suppliers and sell them directly to customers.We started selling computer productsonline in 2004 and had introduced mobile handsets, consumer electronics products and autoparts and accessories by 2007.We significantly expanded ourproduct offerings in 2008 with home appliances and a wide array of general merchandise product categories, such as home furniture, household goods, luxurygoods, sports equipment and mother and childcare products.We began to offer clothing, shoes, and cosmetics and other personal care items in 2009, food,beverage, nutritional supplements, and books in 2010, music, movies and other media products in 2011, e-books and some private label products in 2012,and groceries in 2013.As a result, net revenues from electronics products, which includes computers, mobile handsets and other mobile digital products, andhome appliances, has declined as a percentage of our total net revenues.Online Marketplace              In our online marketplace business, third-party sellers offer products to customers over our online marketplace and pay us commissions on their sales.We launched our online marketplace in October 2010, and have been bringing new products and services to our online marketplace since then.For example,we began to offer ticketing services in 2011, travel-related products and services in 2012, and fresh produce and other groceries in 2013.As ofSeptember 30, 2014, there were over 50,000 third-party sellers over our online marketplace.The GMV from our online marketplace increased fromRMB2.9 billion in 2011 to RMB16.6 billion in 2012 and RMB31.8 billion (US$5.3 billion) in 2013, and further to RMB75.2 billion (US$12.3 billion) forthe twelve months ended September 30, 2014.We provide transaction processing and billing services on all orders on our online marketplace, and weleverage our own nationwide fulfillment infrastructure to offer our third-party sellers additional value-added services, including delivery services or acombination of warehousing and delivery services.We require third-party sellers to meet our standards for authenticity and reliability.We aim to offercustomers the same high quality customer experience regardless of the source of the products they choose.We re-launched Paipai's C2C marketplace in July 2014 following our acquisition of the business from Tencent in March 2014.The enhancedplatform is dedicated to providing consumers with increased selection of long-tail products.We believe that this C2C business complements our existingonline marketplace business, and we intend to invest significant resources in expanding Paipai's C2C marketplace.Other Services              The significant scale of our business allows us to provide a variety of services to create value for our business partners and ultimately benefit ourcustomers.For example, we provide extra value-added fulfillment services to the third-party sellers on our online marketplace, including their choice ofeither delivery services or a combination of warehousing plus delivery services, in addition to the basic transaction processing and billing services that weprovide to them at no extra cost.We also provide online advertising services in various formats, including a proprietary online marketing technologyplatform we recently launched to offer services to our suppliers and sellers on our marketplace.In addition, we have recently begun to engage in internetfinancing activities and we have developed127Table of Contentsvarious financial products, including supply chain financing, as an additional value-added service we provide to our suppliers and third-party sellers on ouronline marketplace, and consumer financing.Customer Experience              Our slogan is \"  \" (selection, speed, quality, value), and we are committed to optimizing customer experience and achieving customersatisfaction.This commitment drives every aspect of our operations, which are focused on six core components: extensive product offerings, compellingonline experience, competitive pricing, timely and accurate fulfillment, convenient payment options and superior customer service.Products              We continually seek to add more products that appeal to our target customers.The number of products we offer has grown rapidly.Our offerings areorganized into 14 product categories on our website:•computers, including desktop, laptop, notebook and other varieties, as well as printers and other office equipment; •mobile handsets and other digital products; •home appliances; •automobile accessories; •clothing and shoes; •luxury goods, including handbags, watches and jewelry; •furniture and household goods; •cosmetics and other personal care items; •food; •nutritional supplements; •books, e-books, music, movies and other media products; •mother and childcare products and toys; •sports and fitness equipment; and •virtual goods, including domestic airplane tickets, hotel room reservations, tickets to the performing arts, and credits for online games and cellphones.Each of these categories is further divided into numerous subcategories to facilitate browsing.In building up our product offerings, we focus on quality as well as quantity.Due to our nationwide reach and our efficient fulfillment system,suppliers often choose us to launch new products that they expect will be in high demand, and we often act as the exclusive distributor for a period of days orweeks when a hot new product first becomes available for sale to the public.For example, we were authorized in July 2013 to sell LG-D802 WCDMA mobilephones on an exclusive basis in China for a one-year period, and since we started reselling Lenovo products online in 2008, we have been authorized to sellmany of Lenovo's new products as its exclusive online retailer in China for a certain period of time following their launch.128Table of ContentsOnline Experience              We believe that providing a compelling online experience is critical to attracting and retaining customers and increasing orders.We make salesprimarily through our content-rich and user-friendly website www.jd.com and mobile applications.Our website not only offers a broad selection of authenticproducts at competitive prices but also provides easy site navigation, basic and advanced search functions, comprehensive product information and a largevolume of customer reviews and ratings.These features address customers' desire to view, understand and compare products before purchasing.With theincreasing popularity of mobile internet-enabled devices, we have also developed applications and features adapted to mobile internet users, and wecurrently offer mobile access through our mobile website m.jd.com and our various iOS, Android and Windows-based mobile applications.As part of ourstrategic partnership with Tencent, we have launched level 1 access on Tencent's Weixin and Mobile QQ, whereby Tencent users can easily access ourproduct offerings and have enjoyable mobile shopping experience.Approximately 29.6% of our orders fulfilled were placed through our mobile applicationsin the third quarter of 2014, as compared to approximately 9.8% in the third quarter of 2013.Our website contains the following information and features:              Comprehensive product information.Each product page contains pictures of the product, the price, a pull-down menu to show whether the productis in stock at the customer's location, customer reviews and ratings, the discount from the suggested retail price, and whether the product will be delivered byus or by one of our third-party sellers.Depending on the type of product, there will be additional information to help the customer make a purchase decisionor recommendations to steer the customer towards additional products.Interactive user community.Our website contains a large volume of helpful user-generated content.For each product, customers can provide reviewsand ratings that are featured prominently on the product page.We encourage participation by granting membership points for posting reviews and ratings,and popular products may have thousands of reviews.We believe that we have the largest online product review database of any online direct sales companyin China, which benefits our customers, suppliers and third-party sellers.We provide discussion boards where customers can discuss topics of mutual interest,respond to each other's questions, and post photos and text to share their experiences with our products.We believe that user-generated content is an effectivetool for giving customers the confidence to order products online that they are not personally familiar with.Product recommendations.Our business intelligence system generates recommendations to customers of additional products that they may wish tobuy.These recommendations come in two forms.Each product page typically has recommendations for other products that are often purchased together withthat product.In addition, our website makes recommendations to customers based on their past purchases and on products that they viewed but did notpurchase.We send several million e-mails to our customers each day with recommendations tailored to their purchase profile.Our sales volume gives usextensive marketing data about customer preferences that we believe enables us to make recommendations that are appealing to our customers.Online order tracking.Customers can log into their accounts to check the status of their orders.All packages in our system are given a bar code andtheir location is updated each time they are handled by one of our warehouse or delivery personnel or one of our contracted third-party couriers.Furthermore,each of our delivery personnel carries a mobile personal digital assistant, which allows customers to track their location in real time on an online map.129Table of ContentsPricing              We offer competitive pricing to attract and retain customers.We make continual efforts to maintain and improve an efficient cost structure and createincentives for our suppliers to provide us with competitive prices.Pricing policy.We set our prices to be competitive with those on other major online retail websites and in physical stores in China.We typicallynegotiate with our suppliers for prices that are comparable to or lower than those offered to retailers in other sales channels.If we reduce the price on ourwebsite before the product is delivered to the customer, then the customer generally has an opportunity to lock in the lower price.Currently, third-partysellers are free to set their own prices on our online marketplace.Special promotions.We offer a selection of discounted products on special occasions, such as the anniversary of the founding of our company onJune 18 and China's new online shopping festival on November 11, and on important holidays such as Christmas and Chinese New Year.We also hold dailypromotions for selected products for a limited period of time.Special promotions attract bargain hunters and give our customers an additional incentive tovisit our website regularly.We have set aside a special area of our website for auctions of certain repaired goods, used goods, and goods that have beenopened but not used.We also offer discounted products to our customers under a group purchase model.We believe that auctions and group purchasesgenerate excitement and give customers a more varied shopping experience.Delivery              We believe that timely and reliable fulfillment is critical to the continuing success of our business.To this end, we have incurred and will continue toincur significant expenditures in building and operating our own nationwide fulfillment infrastructure.The following are some of the advantages that derivefrom our nationwide fulfillment infrastructure:              Delivery network and personnel.We delivered products directly to customers in 1,855 counties and districts across China as of September 30, 2014.We deliver a majority of the orders directly to customers ourselves.Given that customers place their orders online but often choose the payment-on-deliveryoption, our customers interact with delivery personnel more often than with any other representatives of our company.For this reason, we place greatemphasis on training our delivery personnel and setting up delivery stations in more and more counties and districts.We believe that our professionallytrained delivery personnel are important in helping us to shape customer experience and distinguish ourselves from our competitors.Flexible delivery arrangements.We believe that timely and convenient delivery is an essential part of customer satisfaction, and we arrange ourdelivery schedule to suit our customers' needs.Customers can choose their preferred delivery period during a day, including evening delivery, when theyplace orders.Our delivery personnel contact customers by telephone to arrange a convenient time for delivery.Customers who need to reschedule a deliverycan log into their account on our website to look up the contact information for the delivery person and contact the delivery person directly themselves,provided that the delivery will be made by our employees.Speedy delivery.We introduced our 211 program in 2010, and it covered 130 counties and districts across China as of September 30, 2014.Forgoods that we have in stock at the corresponding fulfillment center or front distribution center, any orders received by the morning deadline (11:00 a.m. inmost of the locations) will be delivered on the same day, and any orders received by the evening deadline (11:00 p.m.) will be delivered by 3:00 p.m. on thefollowing day.In five of the seven cities where we have fulfillment centers currently, customers also can request that an order placed by 3:00 p.m. bedelivered in the evening on the same day.There is no extra charge for expedited delivery130Table of Contentsunder our 211 program for orders that satisfy the minimum size requirement, and customers can check the product page on our website to see whether theproduct is in stock and thus eligible.The program does not cover delivery to addresses through third-party couriers or products shipped directly from ourthird-party sellers.Bulky items such as refrigerators or washing machines are also eligible for same-day or next-day delivery under similar conditions.Our211 program applied to approximately 43.8% of the orders we delivered in the first nine months of 2014 and 41% of the orders we delivered in 2013.We alsocurrently provide next-day delivery to addresses in another 815 counties and districts across China.Customers can also request expedited delivery withinthree hours by paying an extra charge in a few of the major cities where we have fulfillment centers.Customer pickup.Customers who prefer to pick up their order themselves can select a pickup station when placing the order and use the trackingfunction on our website to find out when the order has arrived there.We had 1,045 pickup stations at convenient locations across the country as ofSeptember 30, 2014.Payment can be made at the pickup station.Global shipping.We can ship to addresses outside of China using trusted third-party courier services such as UPS, DHL and EMS.The cost ofdelivery is calculated and charged based on the shipping method, destination country/region and the combined product weight.We take payment throughPayPal for sales outside of China.Payment              Payment-on-delivery.We accept payment-on-delivery in all of the 1,855 counties and districts where we make deliveries through our own deliverypersonnel.Our delivery personnel carry mobile POS machines for processing debit cards and credit cards and they also accept cash.Customers chosepayment-on-delivery approximately 33.4% of the time in 2013 and 31.8% in the first nine months of 2014.Online payment.Customers may pay online at the time they place their order, using domestic Chinese credit or debit cards or third-party onlinepayment platforms such as 99Bill, CMPay and UnionPay.Customers chose online payment approximately 65.7% of the time in 2013 and 68.0% in the firstnine months of 2014.We have launched our own online payment and settlement services, which we plan to use for all of our own payment processing needs.Other payment options.Customers may also choose to pay by postal money order.Enterprise customers can also make payment by wire transfer.Customers chose other payment options less than 1% of the time in 2013 and the first nine months of 2014.Customer Service              Providing satisfactory customer services is a high priority.Our commitment to customers is reflected in the high service levels provided by ourcustomer service staff as well as in our product return and exchange policies.24-7 customer service center.We have a 24-7 customer service center in Suqian City, Jiangsu Province, with 3,025 customer service representativesas of September 30, 2014.Customers can call our telephone hotline, ask questions and leave complaints in writing through our website, or send us e-mails.Our customer representatives handled over 20 million customer-initiated communications over the telephone in 2013 and over 18 million in the first ninemonths of 2014.We opened a second customer service center in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, in 2011 to focus on handling written questions or complaintsonline through instant messaging, and we had 2,060 customer service representatives at that center as of September 30, 2014.131Table of Contents              Order modification and cancellation.We generally allow customers to modify or cancel an order any time before the warehouse prints out the orderfor picking and packing.Customers can add or remove items and change the delivery address and delivery method.They may do this online or through ourcustomer service center.Returns and exchanges.We generally allow customers to return unused goods within 7 days and to exchange defective goods within 15 days, ineach case counting from the date when the customer receives the product.If customers report defects more than 15 days after receipt but still within thewarranty period, we will have defective goods repaired or take other appropriate action to satisfy the customer, depending on the nature of the problem.Wewill generally pick up defective items for return or exchange at the customer's address, provided that the return or exchange is requested within 15 days ofreceipt of the item and the address is one that is serviced by our own employees or by one of the third-party couriers that have agreed to provide this servicefor us.Otherwise, the customer can mail the item to one of our fulfillment centers or bring it in person to one of our pickup stations.The same policies applyto products sold through our online marketplace.Membership program.We have established a membership program to cultivate customer loyalty and encourage our customers to make additionalpurchases.There are five levels of members, and promotion to higher levels is based on the amount that the customer has spent with us and also thecustomer's level of activity on our website, for example in reviewing or recommending products.Members get a variety of benefits that increase with level,such as expanded free shipping and access to a special VIP customer service hotline.We grant membership points to members who take part in specialpromotions, review products on our website and recommend our website to friends.Members can convert their membership points into credit towards newpurchases on our website.Merchandise Sourcing              In our online direct sales business, we sourced products from approximately 6,000 suppliers and 6,400 suppliers as of December 31, 2013 andSeptember 30, 2014, respectively.Procuring products on such a massive scale requires considerable expertise, which we have built up over a number of years.Among the top 100 suppliers (by value of purchases) from which we sourced products in 2013, 47 of them are manufacturers, accounting for approximately46% of the aggregate value of purchases from these top 100 suppliers.For the first nine months of 2014, 48 of the top 100 suppliers (by value of purchases)from which we sourced products are manufacturers, accounting for approximately 51% of the aggregate value of purchases from these top 100 suppliers.Wenegotiate with the manufacturer or a higher-level distributor where possible in order to obtain the most favorable terms, even if we sign a contract with alower-level distributor for operational reasons.None of our suppliers accounted for over 10% (by value) of the products we purchased in 2013 and the firstnine months of 2014.In addition, we had approximately 23,500 third-party sellers and over 50,000 third-party sellers on our online marketplace as ofDecember 31, 2013 and September 30, 2014, respectively.As we increase in scale in particular product categories, we expect to increase our purchases directly from manufacturers and, where appropriate, tobecome an authorized reseller.We believe that our ability to establish direct relationships with manufacturers will provide improved product pricing andaccess to hard-to-get products.We believe that manufacturers and distributors consider us an important channel in certain product categories such ascomputers and mobile devices, where we are one of the largest channels in China, and we are gaining significant traction in related categories like homeelectronics.In addition, we have created a supplier interface on our website where our suppliers and third-party sellers access reports regarding inventorystatus, purchase history and customer reviews of their products.Suppliers and third-party sellers can use this information in their marketing and productdevelopment efforts and also in managing their own inventory, which helps them manage costs and makes our services more valuable to them.Leveragingour scale, strong brand and geographic reach, we seek to enter into exclusive arrangements with selected suppliers and third-party sellers for132Table of Contentssome or all of their products.For example, we were authorized in July 2013 to sell LG-D802 WCDMA mobile phones in China for a one-year period.Our relationships with suppliers and third-party sellers evolve and grow over time.The following are a few examples:•Kimberly-Clark.We started sourcing products, mainly Huggies disposable diapers, from Kimberly-Clark directly in 2012.Starting in 2012,Kimberly-Clark allocated a specified area of its warehouse in Beijing to us, and in 2013 it did the same with its warehouse in Guangzhou.Theproducts we have purchased from Kimberly-Clark are stored in these specified areas, and after packing will be shipped directly to our sortingcenters, which ensures fast fulfillment of orders from our customers and saves our warehousing space.In 2013, we also started cooperation withKimberly-Clark in the areas of marketing and consumer data.When Kimberly-Clark launched its high-end diaper called Huggies Platinum inChina in 2013, we were the sole online distributor for the initial four months.•BESTSELLER.BESTSELLER sells apparel in the China market mainly under four brands: ONLY, Vero Moda, Selected and Jack Jones.InJune 2012, BESTSELLER opened online stores for its ONLY and Jack Jones brands on our online marketplace.Based on the performance ofthese two online stores, BESTSELLER opened two more stores in January 2013 for Vero Moda and Selected.Currently, BESTSELLER usesour delivery services for all of the four online stores to improve its customer experience.BESTSELLER also offers certain series of apparelexclusively on our online marketplace.•Lenovo.We started reselling Lenovo PCs in 2008 and Lenovo tablets in 2011 online.Since then, Lenovo has authorized us to resell many ofits new products as the exclusive online retailer in China for a certain period of time following their launch.Moreover, we have also beenauthorized to resell certain SKUs of Lenovo PCs and tablets on an exclusive basis.Lenovo has also collaborated with us in its marketingactivities, for instance linking certain types of products in its online ads to our website.We select suppliers and third-party sellers on the basis of brand, reliability, volume and price.They must be able to meet our demands for timelysupply of authentic products and also provide high quality post-sale customer service.We perform background checks on each supplier and third-party sellerand the products it provides before we enter into any agreement.We examine their business licenses and the qualification certificates for their products, andcheck their brand recognition and make inquiries about the market acceptance of their products among players in the same industry.We also conduct on-sitevisits to assess and verify their location, scale of business, production capacity, property and equipment, human resources, research and developmentcapability, quality control system and fulfillment capability.Our standard form contract requires suppliers and third-party sellers to represent that their goodsare authentic and from lawful sources and do not infringe upon lawful rights of third parties and to pay us liquidated damages for any breach.We normallyenter into one-year framework agreements with our suppliers and third-party sellers and renew them annually if we are satisfied with the supplier's or third-party seller's performance.We have also put stringent rules in place governing the operations of third-party sellers on our online marketplace.Third-partysellers will be subject to penalties or be asked to end their operations on our online marketplace if they violate the marketplace rules, for example by sellingcounterfeit products.We also conduct regular reviews on the performance of third-party sellers, twice a year, and have the right to terminate the operations ofthird-party sellers that remain inactive on our online marketplace for three consecutive months or have an overall ranking below a certain threshold.We have leveraged our insights into our suppliers' business operations to develop various financial products, including supply chain financing, as anadditional value-added service we provide to our suppliers, which we believe will further strengthen our merchandising capability.We have also133Table of Contentslaunched our own online payment platform, which we plan to use for all of our own payment processing needs.Fulfillment              We deliver a compelling customer experience by fulfilling orders quickly and accurately.To this end, we have built our nationwide fulfillmentinfrastructure for the prompt receipt, storage and shipment of our products.Our fulfillment infrastructure is primarily comprised of a nationwide warehouseand delivery network that we operate ourselves, supplemented by contracted third-party couriers to service areas that are not covered by our network.Tofurther enhance inventory accountability and security, we track our inventory at all stages of the receiving and order fulfillment process.Nationwide Fulfillment Infrastructure              We have built a nationwide fulfillment infrastructure that we believe is the largest among all e-commerce companies in China.We had established fulfillment centers in seven major cities in China as of September 30, 2014: Shenyang in the northeast, Beijing in the north,Shanghai in the east, Wuhan in the center, Guangzhou in the south, Chengdu in the southwest and Xi'an in the northwest.Each of these fulfillment centersconsists of between 3 and 15 warehouses for normal-sized items, 1 warehouse for bulky items, and associated sorting centers and related facilities.We hadalso established front distribution centers in another twelve major cities in China as of September 30, 2014: Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, Xiamen, Chongqing,Zhengzhou, Nanning, Changsha, Harbin, Hefei, Kunming and Urumqi.Each front distribution center consists of one warehouse stocking products that are inhigh demand with high turnover, one warehouse for bulky items, and associated sorting centers and related facilities.We have also established standalonewarehouses for bulky items in another 20 cities in China.We operated a total of 118 warehouses with an aggregate gross floor area of approximately2.3 million square meters in 39 cities as of September 30, 2014.We operated 2,045 delivery stations and 1,045 pickup stations in 1,855 counties and districts across China as of September 30, 2014.Each deliverystation has a delivery team ranging from 1 to 50 persons.We operate 325 additional delivery stations under contractual arrangements, whereby the contracteddelivery stations deliver our orders following the same standard as our own delivery stations, while the personnel at those delivery stations are not part of ourheadcount.Each pickup station has two to four people available 10 hours a day and 7 days a week to handle customers' pickups and on-site payment.134Table of Contents              The following map shows our nationwide logistics and delivery network as of September 30, 2014:              We deliver a majority of the orders directly to customers ourselves.We maintain cooperation arrangements with a number of third-party couriers todeliver our products to our customers in those areas not covered by our own fulfillment infrastructure, particularly in smaller and less developed cities.Third-party sellers also use third-party couriers if they do not use our delivery services.Fulfillment Process              The following flow chart outlines our fulfillment process:135Table of Contents              When a customer places an order, our delivery management system automatically processes the order and matches it to the warehouse or warehouseswith the appropriate inventory.Picking is done manually on the basis of instructions that are generated automatically by our warehouse management system.The warehouse management system also automatically generates the bar codes and shipping labels that allow our staff to match the items to the correct orderin the packing process.After picking and packing, the sorting center at the warehouse ships the order to a delivery or pickup station in the customer's city forfurther handling and delivery.Products from different warehouses are not combined before shipping, so some orders require multiple deliveries.If thecustomer's address is not one to which we make deliveries ourselves, we will have a third-party courier pick up the order at our sorting center to make thedelivery.In some cases we also use third-party couriers to carry orders between a sorting center and a delivery station.Once the order has shipped, our systemautomatically updates the inventory level for each product in the order, ensuring that additional inventory will be ordered as needed.Our customers can trackthe shipping status of their orders through our website at each step in the process.We are in the process of constructing new, larger, custom-designed warehouses on land where we have obtained land use rights in Shanghai,Guangzhou and Shenyang.We launched the initial phase of the new fulfillment center in Shanghai in October 2014, comprising a total floor space ofapproximately 100,000 square meters with capacity to sort up to 16,000 packages per hour, and we expect to put the fulfillment centers in Guangzhou andShenyang into operation in 2015.We plan to construct additional such warehouses in two other cities where we currently have fulfillment centers, Beijingand Wuhan.We believe that building our own custom-designed warehouses will not only increase our storage capacity but also allow us to restructure andreorganize our fulfillment workflow and processes.Technology Platform              We have built our technology platform relying primarily on software and systems that we have developed in-house and to a lesser extent on third-party software that we have modified and incorporated.Our server fleet consisted of approximately 21,482 servers stored in multiple locations across thecountry as of September 30, 2014, and we employed 4,724 IT professionals to design, develop and operate our technology platform as of the same date,including the IT professionals we have hired from Tencent in connection with our recent transactions with Tencent.We believe that creating a comparabletechnology platform is an expensive and time-consuming process and constitutes a significant barrier to entry for potential competitors.Our proprietary technology platform

data analytics.Our strong technology platform is vital in supporting our pursuit of a continually improving customer experience, including the customer experienceof our mobile users.From our website,

continue to develop our business intelligence system to effectively utilize the huge amount of transaction, logging and click stream datagenerated by our website.We are in the process of rolling out a big data platform built on top of our cloud computing infrastructure, which will furtherautomate and streamline our data extraction, loading, transformation and mining on a distributed data storage infrastructure with unified logical data models,unified data sources, and unified access and access control.Marketing              We believe that the most effective form of marketing is to continually enhance our customer experience, as customer satisfaction engenders word-of-mouth referrals and additional purchases.We have been able to build a large base of loyal customers primarily through providing superior customerexperience and conducting marketing and brand promotion activities.We provide various incentives to our customers to increase their spending and loyalty,and we send e-mails to our customers periodically with product recommendations or promotions.We conduct marketing activities online through major search engines, portals, social media, online video and other major websites in China.Toenhance our brand awareness, we also have engaged in brand promotion activities such as sponsoring high profile sports events and advertising on nationaltelevision networks.In 2013, we became the official sponsor of the China Football Association137Table of ContentsSuper League, the top soccer league in China, for a period of five seasons, and we also sponsored several popular movies, TV shows and variety shows.Weincurred RMB479 million, RMB1,097 million, RMB1,590 million (US$263 million) and RMB2,540 million (US$414 million) of marketing expenses in2011, 2012, 2013 and the first nine months of 2014, respectively.Competition              The online retail industry in China is intensely competitive.Our current or potential competitors include (i) major online retailers in China that offera wide range of general merchandise product categories, such as Alibaba Group, which operates taobao.com and tmall.com, and Amazon China, whichoperates amazon.cn, and (ii) major traditional retailers in China that are moving into online retailing, such as Suning Appliance Company Limited, whichoperates suning.com, Walmart, which holds a majority interest in yihaodian.com, and Gome Electrical Appliances, which operates gome.com.cn.We also facecompetition from online retail companies in China focused on specific product categories and from physical retail stores, including big-box stores like RT-Mart that also aim to offer a one-stop shopping experience.We anticipate that the online retail market will continually evolve and will continue to experience rapid technological change, evolving industrystandards, shifting customer requirements, and frequent innovation.We must continually innovate to remain competitive.We believe that the principalcompetitive factors in our industry are:•brand recognition and reputation; •product quality and selection; •pricing; •fulfillment capabilities; and •customer service.In addition, new and enhanced technologies may increase the competition in the online retail industry.New competitive business models mayappear, for example based on new forms of social media or social commerce.We believe that we are well-positioned to effectively compete on the basis of the factors listed above.However, some of our current or futurecompetitors may have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, better supplier relationships, larger customer bases or greater financial, technicalor marketing resources than we do.Our Corporate Values and Employees              As of September 30,

rules and regulations that affect our business activities in China.Regulations Relating to Foreign Investment              Industry Catalogue Relating to Foreign Investment.Investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are principally governed by theGuidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment, or the Catalogue, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the Ministry ofCommerce and the National Development and Reform Commission.Industries listed in the Catalogue are divided into three categories: encouraged,restricted and prohibited.Industries not listed in the Catalogue are generally deemed as constituting a fourth \"permitted\" category.Establishment of whollyforeign-owned enterprises is generally allowed in encouraged and permitted industries.Some restricted industries are limited to equity or contractual jointventures, while in some cases Chinese partners are required to hold the majority interests in such joint ventures.In addition, restricted category projects aresubject to higher-level government approvals.Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category.Industries not listed in theCatalogue are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations.Through our subsidiaries and variable interest entities, we are engaged in certain industries that are classified as \"restricted\" or \"prohibited\" under theCatalogue.Pursuant to the latest Catalogue amended in 2011, sales and distribution of audio and video products are in the restricted categories and onlycontractual joint ventures can engage in the distribution of audio and video products in China.Online wholesale and retail are in the restricted category andthe establishment of

Industry, the predecessor of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT, issued theCircular on Strengthening the Administration of Foreign Investment in the Operation of Value-added Telecommunications Business, pursuant to which adomestic PRC company that holds an operating license for value-added telecommunications business, which we refer to as an ICP License, is

service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain proceduralrequirements.By contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreigncurrency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans.In August 2008, SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment andSettlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular No.142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested enterpriseof foreign currency-registered capital into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used.SAFE Circular No.142 provides that the RMB capitalconverted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by theapplicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC.In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow anduse of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises.The use of such RMB capital may not be changedwithout SAFE's approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used.Furthermore, SAFE promulgated a circular in November 2010, Circular 59, which tightens the regulation over settlement of net proceeds from overseasofferings like our initial public offering and requires, among other things, the authenticity of settlement of net proceeds from offshore offerings to be closelyexamined and the net proceeds to be settled in the manner described in the offering documents or otherwise approved by the board.Violations may result insevere monetary or other penalties.154Table of Contents              In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign DirectInvestment which substantially amends and simplifies the current foreign exchange procedure.Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various specialpurpose foreign exchange accounts (e.g.pre-establishment expenses account, foreign exchange capital account, guarantee account), the reinvestment oflawful incomes derived by foreign investors in the PRC (e.g.profit, proceeds of equity transfer, capital reduction, liquidation and early repatriation ofinvestment), and purchase and remittance of foreign exchange as a result of capital reduction, liquidation, early repatriation or share transfer in a foreign-invested enterprise no longer require SAFE approval, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was notpossible before.In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over DomesticDirect Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branchesover direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business

transfer they are required, within three months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, to sendto each of the transferor and the transferee notice of such refusal.Directors' Power to Issue Shares.Our memorandum and articles of association authorize our board of directors to issue additional ordinary sharesfrom time to time as our board of directors shall determine, to the extent of available authorized but unissued shares.Our memorandum and articles of association also authorize our board of directors to establish from time to time one or more series of preference sharesand to determine, with respect to any series of preference shares, the terms and rights of that series, including:•the designation of the series; •the number of shares of the series; •the dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights; and •the rights and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences.Our board of directors may issue preference shares without action by our shareholders to the extent authorized but unissued.Issuance of these sharesmay dilute the voting power of holders of ordinary shares.Exempted Company.We are an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands.The Companies Law inthe Cayman Islands distinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies.Any company that is registered in the Cayman Islands butconducts business mainly outside of the Cayman Islands may apply to be registered as an exempted company.The requirements for an exempted companyare essentially the same as for an ordinary company except for the exemptions and privileges listed below:•an exempted company does not have to file an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies; •an exempted company's register of members is not required to be open to inspection; •an exempted company does not have to hold an annual general meeting; •an exempted company may issue no par value, negotiable or bearer shares;173Table of Contents•an exempted company may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are usually given for20 years in the first instance); •an exempted company may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands; •an exempted company may register as a limited duration company; and •an exempted company may register as a segregated portfolio company.\"Limited liability\" means that the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount unpaid by the shareholder on that shareholder's shares of thecompany (except in exceptional circumstances, such as involving fraud, the establishment of an agency relationship or an illegal or improper purpose orother circumstances in which a court may be prepared to pierce or lift the corporate veil).We are subject to reporting and other informational requirements ofthe Exchange Act, as applicable to foreign private issuers.Except as otherwise disclosed in this prospectus, we currently intend to comply with the NASDAQrules in lieu of following home country practice.Register of Members.Under the Companies Law, we must keep a register of members and there should be entered therein:•the names and addresses of our members, a statement of the shares held by each member, and of the amount paid or agreed to be considered aspaid, on the shares of each member; •the date on which the name of any person was entered on the register as a member; and •the date on which any person ceased to be a member.Under Cayman Islands law, the register of members of our company is prima facie evidence of the matters set out therein (i.e.the register of memberswill raise a presumption of fact on the matters referred to above unless rebutted) and a member registered in the register of members is deemed as a matter ofCayman Islands law to have legal title to the shares as set against its name in the register of members.Upon the completion of this offering, the register ofmembers will be immediately updated to record and give effect to the transfer of shares by the selling shareholders to the depositary (or its nominee) as thedepositary.Once our register of members has been updated, the shareholders recorded in the register of members will be deemed to have legal title to theshares set against their name.If the name of any person is incorrectly entered in or omitted from our register of members, or if there is any default or unnecessary delay in enteringon the register the fact of any person having ceased to be a member of our company, the person or member aggrieved (or any member of our company or ourcompany itself) may apply to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands for an order that the register be rectified, and the Court may either refuse suchapplication or it may, if satisfied of the justice of the case, make an order for the rectification of the register.Differences in Corporate Law              The Companies Law is derived, to a large extent, from the older Companies Acts of England but does not follow recent United Kingdom statutoryenactments, and accordingly there are significant differences between the Companies Law and the current Companies Act of England.In addition, theCompanies Law differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders.Set forth below is a summary of the significant differencesbetween the provisions of the Companies Law applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States and their shareholders.Mergers and Similar Arrangements.The Companies Law permits mergers and consolidations between Cayman Islands companies and betweenCayman Islands companies and non-Cayman Islands companies.For these purposes, (a) \"merger\" means the merging of two or more constituent companies174Table of Contentsand the vesting of their undertaking, property and liabilities in one of such companies as the surviving company and (b) a \"consolidation\" means thecombination of two or more constituent companies into a combined company and the vesting of the undertaking, property and liabilities of such companiesto the consolidated company.In order to effect such a merger or consolidation, the directors of each constituent company must approve a written plan ofmerger or consolidation, which must then be authorized by (a) a special resolution of the shareholders of each constituent company, and (b) such otherauthorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company's articles of association.The written plan of merger or consolidation must be filed withthe Registrar of Companies together with a declaration as to the solvency of the consolidated or surviving company, a list of the assets and liabilities of eachconstituent company and an undertaking that a copy of the certificate of merger or consolidation will be given to the members and creditors of eachconstituent company and that notification of the merger or consolidation will be published in the Cayman Islands Gazette.Dissenting shareholders have theright to be paid the fair value of their shares (which, if not agreed between the parties, will be determined by the Cayman Islands court) if they follow therequired procedures, subject to certain exceptions.Court approval is not required for a merger or consolidation which is effected in compliance with thesestatutory procedures.In addition, there are statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies, provided that the arrangement isapproved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders or creditors (representing 75% by value) with whom the arrangement is to be made and whomust, in addition, represent three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either inperson or by proxy at a meeting, or meetings, convened for that purpose.The convening of the meetings and subsequently the arrangement must besanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands.While a dissenting shareholder has the right to express to the court the view that the transaction oughtnot to be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it determines that:•the statutory provisions as to the required majority vote have been met; •the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question and the statutory majority are acting bona fide without coercion of theminority to promote interests adverse to those of the class; •the arrangement is such that may be reasonably approved by an intelligent and honest man of that class acting in respect of his interest; and •the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Law.When a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90% of the shares affected within four months, the offeror may, within a two-month periodcommencing on the expiration of such four month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer.Anobjection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands but this is unlikely to succeed in the case of an offer which has been so approved unlessthere is evidence of fraud, bad faith or collusion.If an arrangement and reconstruction is thus approved, the dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights, which wouldotherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of Delaware corporations, providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judiciallydetermined value of the shares.Shareholders' Suits.In principle, we will normally be the proper plaintiff and as a general rule a derivative action may not be brought by a minorityshareholder.However, based on English authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority in the Cayman Islands, the Cayman Islandscourt can be expected to apply and follow the common law principles (namely the rule in175Table of ContentsFoss v. Harbottle and the exceptions thereto) which permit a minority shareholder to commence a class action against, or derivative actions in the name of, acompany to challenge the following:•an acts which is illegal or ultra vires; •an act which, although not ultra vires, could only be effected duly if authorized by a special or qualified majority vote that has not beenobtained; and •an act which constitutes a fraud on the minority where the wrongdoers are themselves in control of the company.Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability.Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company'sarticles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islandscourts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime.Our memorandumand articles of association provide that our directors and officers shall be indemnified against all actions, proceedings, costs, charges, expenses, losses,damages or liabilities incurred or sustained by such director or officer, other than by reason of such person's own dishonesty, willful default or fraud, in orabout the conduct of our company's business or affairs (including as a result of any mistake of judgment) or in the execution or discharge of his duties,powers, authorities or discretions, including without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, any costs, expenses, losses or liabilities incurred by suchdirector or officer in defending (whether successfully or otherwise) any civil proceedings concerning our company or its affairs in any court whether in theCayman Islands or elsewhere.This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delawarecorporation.In addition, we intend to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers that will provide such persons withadditional indemnification beyond that provided in our memorandum and articles of association.Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under theforegoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Actand is therefore unenforceable.Directors' Fiduciary Duties.Under Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and itsshareholders.This duty has two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty.The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the carethat an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances.Under this duty, a director must inform himself of and disclose to shareholders,all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction.The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he or shereasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation.He or she must not use his or her corporate position for personal gain or advantage.Thisduty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interestpossessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally.In general, actions of a director are presumed to havebeen made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation.However, thispresumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties.Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by adirector, a director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation.As a matter of Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the company and thereforehe owes the following duties to the company: a duty to act in good faith in the best interests of the company, a duty not to make a personal profit based onhis or her position as director (unless the company permits him to do so), a duty not to put himself in a position where the interests of the company conflictwith his or her personal interest or his176Table of Contentsor her duty to a third party and a duty to exercise powers for the purpose for which such powers were intended.A director of a Cayman Islands company owesto the company a duty to act with skill and care.It was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his or her duties a greaterdegree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his or her knowledge and experience.However, English and Commonwealth courts havemoved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands.Shareholder Proposals.Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting ofshareholders, provided it complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents.A special meeting may be called by the board of directors or anyother person authorized to do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings.Cayman Islands law provides shareholders with only limited rights to requisition a general meeting, and does not provide shareholders with any rightto put any proposal before a general meeting.However, these rights may be provided in a company's articles of association.Our memorandum and articles ofassociation allow our shareholders holding shares representing in aggregate not less than one-third of the votes attaching to the issued and outstanding sharesof our company entitled to vote at general meetings, to requisition an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders, in which case our directors areobliged to call such meeting and to put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such meeting; however, our memorandum and articles of association donot provide our shareholders with any right to put any proposals before annual general meetings or extraordinary general meetings not called by suchshareholders.Cumulative Voting.Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless thecorporation's certificate of incorporation specifically provides for it.Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders ona board of directors since it permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which increases theshareholder's voting power with respect to electing such director.Cayman Islands law does not prohibit cumulative voting, but our memorandum and articlesof association do not provide for cumulative voting.As a result, our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholdersof a Delaware corporation.Removal of Directors.Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only forcause with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise.Under ourmemorandum and articles of association, directors may be removed by ordinary resolution of our shareholders.Transactions with Interested Shareholders.The Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delawarepublic corporations whereby, unless the corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate ofincorporation or bylaws that is approved by its shareholders, it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with an \"interested shareholder\"for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder.An interested shareholder generally is a person or a group who or whichowns or owned 15% or more of the target's outstanding voting stock or who or which is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and owned 15% or more ofthe corporation's outstanding voting stock within the past three years.This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tieredbid for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally.The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which suchshareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board of directors approves either the business combination or the177Table of Contentstransaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder.This encourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware corporation to negotiatethe terms of any acquisition transaction with the target's board of directors.Cayman Islands law has no comparable statute.As a result, we cannot avail ourselves of the types of protections afforded by the Delaware businesscombination statute.However, although Cayman Islands law does not regulate transactions between a company and its significant shareholders, it doesprovide that such transactions must be entered into bona fide in the best interests of the company and for a proper corporate purpose and not with the effect ofconstituting a fraud on the minority shareholders.Dissolution; Winding Up.Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve, dissolutionmust be approved by shareholders holding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation.Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directorsmay it be approved by a simple majority of the corporation's outstanding shares.Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation to include in its certificate ofincorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board.Under Cayman Islands law, a company may be wound up by either an order of the courts of the Cayman Islands or by a special resolution of itsmembers or, if the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, by an ordinary resolution of its members.The court has authority to order winding upin a number of specified circumstances including where it is, in the opinion of the court, just and equitable to do so.Variation of Rights of Shares.Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the approvalof a majority of the outstanding shares of such class, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise.Under Cayman Islands law and our articles ofassociation, if our share capital is divided into more than one class of shares, we may vary the rights attached to any class only with the written consent of theholders of a majority of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the holders of the shares ofthat class.Amendment of Governing Documents.Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation's certificate of incorporation may be amendedonly if adopted and declared advisable by the board of directors and approved by a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote and the bylaws may beamended with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote and may, if so provided in the certificate of incorporation, also beamended by the board of directors.Under the Companies Law, our memorandum and articles of association may only be amended by special resolution of ourshareholders.Rights of Non-Resident or Foreign Shareholders.There are no limitations imposed by our memorandum and articles of association on the rights ofnon-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on our shares.In addition, there are no provisions in our memorandum and articles ofassociation governing the ownership threshold above which shareholder ownership must be disclosed.Inspection of Books and Records              Holders of our ordinary shares have no general right under Cayman Islands law to inspect or obtain copies of our list of shareholders or our corporaterecords.However, we intend to provide our shareholders with annual audited financial statements.See \"Where You Can Find Additional Information.\"178Table of ContentsHistory of Securities Issuances              The following is a summary of our securities issuances in the

Richard QiangdongLiu, Max Smart Limited and Mr. Richard Qiangdong Liu's associate as defined in the agreement.Set forth below is a description of the registration rightsgranted under the agreement.Demand Registration Rights.At any time after six months following the completion of our initial public offering in May 2014, holders of at least15% of our outstanding registrable securities have the right to demand that we file a registration statement covering the registration of more than 10% of thetotal registrable securities then outstanding or the registration of the registrable securities with anticipated aggregate gross proceeds in excess ofUS$20 million.We, however, are not obligated to effect a demand registration if we have already effected a registration within six months preceding the dateof such request or if we have effected three demand registrations.We have the right to defer filing of a registration statement for a period of not more than90 days after the receipt of the request of the initiating holders if our board of directors determines in good faith that filing of a registration will be materiallydetrimental to us and our shareholders, but we cannot exercise the deferral right more than180Table of Contentsonce in any 12-month period and cannot register any securities during such 12-month period.Further, if the registrable securities are offered by means of anunderwriting and the underwriter advises us in writing that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of securities to be underwritten, a maximumof 75% of such registrable securities may be reduced as required by the underwriters and the number of the registrable securities will be allocated among theholders on a pro rata basis according to the number of registrable securities then outstanding held by each holder requesting registration, provided that in noevent may any registrable securities be excluded from such underwriting unless all other securities are first excluded.Piggyback Registration Rights.If we propose to file a registration statement for a public offering of our securities other than relating to anyemployee benefit plan or a corporate reorganization, we must offer holders of our registrable securities an opportunity to include in the registration all or anypart of their registrable securities.If the managing underwriters of any underwritten offering determine in good faith that marketing factors require alimitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, the managing underwriters may decide to exclude shares from the registration and the underwriting andto allocate the number of securities first to us and second to each of holders requesting for the inclusion of their registrable securities on a pro rata basis basedon the total number of registrable securities held by each such holder and third, to holders of other securities of our company, provided that (1) in no eventmay any registrable securities be excluded from such offering unless all other securities are first excluded, and (2) in no event may the amount of securities ofselling holders of registrable securities be reduced below 25% of the aggregate number of registrable securities requested to be included in such offering.Form F-3 Registration Rights.Holders of at least 15% of our outstanding registrable securities have the right to request that we effect registrationstatements on Form F-3 at any time after our initial public offering.We, however, are not obligated to effect such registration if, among other things,(1) Form F-3 is not available for such offering by the holders of registrable securities, (2) the aggregate anticipated price of such offering is less thanUS$5 million, (3) we have effected a registration within the six-month period preceding the date of such request for Form F-3 registration and (4) we haveeffected at least three Form F-3 registrations in any 12-month period.We have the right to defer filing of a Form F-3 registration statement for a period of notmore than 90 days after the receipt of the request of relevant holders if our board of directors determines in good faith that filing of such registration will bematerially detrimental to us and our shareholders, but we cannot exercise the deferral right more than once in any 12-month period and cannot register anyother securities during such 90-day period.Expenses of Registration.We will bear all registration expenses, other than underwriting discounts and selling commissions incurred in connectionwith any demand, piggyback or F-3 registration, except each holder that exercised its demand, piggyback or F-3 registration rights will bear such holder'sproportionate share (based on the total number of shares sold in such registration other than for our account) of all underwriting discounts and sellingcommissions or other amounts payable to underwriters or brokers.We are also not required to pay for any expenses of any registration proceeding begun inresponse to holders' exercise of their demand registration rights if the registration request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the holders of a majorityof the registrable securities to be registered, subject to a few exceptions.Termination of Obligations.We have no obligation to effect any demand, piggyback or Form F-3 registration upon the earlier of (i) the secondanniversary after the completion of our initial public offering; and (ii) as to any registrable security holder, at such time as all registrable securities owned bysuch holder may be sold in any 90-day period without registration pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, except that Huang River InvestmentLimited has the right to demand on one occasion registration of its shares during the two-year period following March 10, 2017.181Table of ContentsDESCRIPTION OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES American Depositary Shares              Deutsche Bank Trust Company

hold ADSs either directly or indirectly through your broker or other financial institution.If you hold ADSs directly, by having an ADSregistered in your name on the books of the depositary, you are an ADR holder.This description assumes you hold your ADSs directly.If you hold the ADSsthrough your broker or financial institution nominee, you must rely on the procedures of such broker or financial institution to assert the rights of an ADRholder described in this section.You should consult with your broker or financial institution to find out what those procedures are.As an ADR holder, we will not treat you as a shareholder of ours and you will not have any shareholder rights.Cayman Islands law governsshareholder rights.Because the depositary or its nominee will be the shareholder of record for the shares represented by all outstanding ADSs, shareholderrights rest with such record holder.Your rights are those of an ADR holder.Such rights derive from the terms of the deposit agreement to be entered intoamong us, the depositary and all registered holders from time to time of ADSs issued under the deposit agreement.The obligations of the depositary and itsagents are also set out in the deposit agreement.Because the depositary or its nominee will actually be the registered owner of the shares, you must rely on itto exercise the rights of a shareholder on your behalf.The deposit agreement and the ADSs are governed by New York law.The following is a summary of what we believe to be the material terms of the deposit agreement.Notwithstanding this, because it is a summary, itmay not contain all the information that you may otherwise deem important.For more complete information, you should read the entire deposit agreementand the form of ADR which contains the terms of your ADSs.You can read a copy of the deposit agreement which is filed as an exhibit to the registrationstatement of which this prospectus forms apart.You may also obtain a copy of the deposit agreement at the SEC's Public Reference Room which is located at100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549.You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-732-0330.You may also find the registration statement and the attached deposit agreement on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov.Share Dividends and Other DistributionsHow will I receive dividends and other distributions on the shares underlying my ADSs?We may make various types of distributions with respect to our securities.The depositary has agreed that, to the extent practicable, it will pay to youthe cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on shares or other deposited securities, after converting any cash received into U.S.dollars and, in all cases, making any necessary deductions provided for in the deposit agreement.You will receive these distributions in proportion to thenumber of underlying securities that your ADSs represent.182Table of Contents              Except as stated below, the depositary will deliver such distributions to ADR holders in proportion to their interests in the following manner:•Cash.The depositary will distribute any U.S. dollars available to it resulting from a cash dividend or other cash distribution or the netproceeds of sales of any other distribution or portion thereof (to the extent applicable), on an averaged or other practicable basis, subject to(i) appropriate adjustments for taxes withheld, (ii) such distribution being impermissible or impracticable with respect to certain registeredADR holders, and (iii) deduction of the depositary's expenses in (1) converting any foreign currency to U.S. dollars to the extent that itdetermines that such conversion may be made on a reasonable basis, (2) transferring foreign currency or U.S. dollars to the United States bysuch means as the depositary may determine to the extent that it determines that such transfer may be made on a reasonable basis, (3) obtainingany approval or license of any governmental authority required for such conversion or transfer, which is obtainable at a reasonable cost andwithin a reasonable time and (4) making any sale by public or private means in any commercially reasonable manner.The depositary will holdany cash amounts it is unable to distribute in a non-interest-bearing account for the benefit of the applicable holders and beneficial owners ofADSs until the distribution can be effected or the funds that the depositary holds must be escheated as unclaimed property in accordance withthe laws of the relevant states of the United States.If exchange rates fluctuate during a time when the depositary cannot convert a foreigncurrency, you may lose some or all of the value of the distribution.•Shares.In the case of a distribution in shares, the depositary will issue additional ADRs to evidence the number of ADSs representing suchshares.Only whole ADSs will be issued.Any shares which would result in fractional ADSs will be sold and the net proceeds will be distributedin the same manner as cash to the ADR holders entitled thereto.•Rights to Receive Additional Shares.In the case of a distribution of rights to subscribe for additional shares or other rights, if we provideevidence satisfactory to the depositary that it may lawfully distribute such rights, the depositary will distribute warrants or other instruments inthe discretion of the depositary representing such rights.However, if we do not furnish such evidence, the depositary may: •sell such rights if practicable and distribute the net proceeds in the same manner as cash to the ADR holders entitled thereto; or •if it is not practicable to sell such rights, do nothing and allow such rights to lapse, in which case ADR holders will receive nothing.We have no obligation to file a registration statement under the Securities Act in order to make any rights available to ADR holders.•Other Distributions.In the case of a distribution of securities or property other than those described above, the depositary may either(i) distribute such securities or property in any manner it deems equitable and practicable or (ii) to the extent the depositary deems distributionof such securities or property not to be equitable and practicable, sell such securities or property and distribute any net proceeds in the sameway it distributes cash.If the depositary determines that any distribution described above is not practicable with respect to any specific registered ADR holder, the depositarymay choose any method of distribution that it deems practicable for such ADR holder, including the distribution of foreign currency, securities or property, orit may retain such items, without paying interest on or investing them, on behalf of the ADR holder as deposited securities, in which case the ADSs will alsorepresent the retained items.183Table of Contents              Any U.S. dollars will be distributed by checks drawn on a bank in the United States for whole dollars and cents.Fractional cents will be withheldwithout liability and dealt with by the depositary in accordance with its then current practices.The depositary is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any ADR holders.We cannot assure you that the depositary will be able to convert any currency at a specified exchange rate or sell any property, rights, shares or othersecurities at a specified price, nor that any of such transactions can be completed within a specified time period.Deposit, Withdrawal and CancellationHow does the depositary issue ADSs?The depositary will issue ADSs if you or your broker deposit shares or evidence of rights to receive shares with the custodian and pay the fees andexpenses owing to the depositary in connection with such issuance.In the case of the ADSs to be issued under this prospectus, we will arrange with theunderwriters named herein to deposit such shares.Shares deposited in the future with the custodian must be accompanied by certain delivery documentation and shall, at the time of such deposit, beregistered in the name of Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as depositary for the benefit of holders of ADRs or in such other name as the depositaryshall direct.The custodian will hold all deposited shares (including those being deposited by or on our behalf in connection with the offering to which thisprospectus relates) for the account of the depositary.ADR holders thus have no direct ownership interest in the shares and only have such rights as arecontained in the deposit agreement.The custodian will also hold any additional securities, property and cash received on or in substitution for the depositedshares.The deposited shares and any such additional items are referred to as \"deposited securities\".Upon each deposit of shares, receipt of related delivery documentation and compliance with the other provisions of the deposit agreement, includingthe payment of the fees and charges of the depositary and any taxes or other fees or charges owing, the depositary will issue an ADR or ADRs in the name orupon the order of the person entitled thereto evidencing the number of ADSs to which such person is entitled.All of the ADSs issued will, unless specificallyrequested to the contrary, be part of the depositary's direct registration system, and a registered holder will receive periodic statements from the depositarywhich will show the number of ADSs registered in such holder's name.An ADR holder can request that the ADSs not be held through the depositary's directregistration system and that a certificated ADR be issued.How do ADR holders cancel an ADS and obtain deposited securities?When you turn in your ADR certificate at the depositary's office, or when you provide proper instructions and documentation in the case of directregistration ADSs, the depositary will, upon payment of certain applicable fees, charges and taxes, deliver the underlying shares to you or upon your writtenorder.At your risk, expense and request, the depositary may deliver deposited securities at such other place as you may request.The depositary may only restrict the withdrawal of deposited securities in connection with:•temporary delays caused by closing our transfer books or those of the depositary or the deposit of shares in connection with voting at ashareholders' meeting, or the payment of dividends;184Table of Contents•the payment of fees, taxes and similar charges; or •compliance with any U.S. or foreign laws or governmental regulations relating to the ADRs or to the withdrawal of deposited securities.This right of withdrawal may not be limited by any other provision of the deposit agreement.Record Dates              The depositary may, after consultation with us if practicable, fix record dates for the determination of the registered ADR holders who will be entitled(or obligated, as the case may be):•to receive any distribution on or in respect of shares, •to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at a meeting of holders of shares, •to pay the fee assessed by the depositary for administration of the ADR program and for any expenses as provided for in the ADR, or •to receive any notice or to act in respect of other matters              all subject to the provisions of the deposit agreement.Voting RightsHow do I vote?If you are an ADR holder and the depositary asks you to provide it with voting instructions, you may instruct the depositary how to exercise thevoting rights for the shares which underlie your ADSs.As soon as practicable after receiving notice of any meeting or solicitation of consents or proxies fromus, the depositary will distribute to the registered ADR holders a notice stating such information as is contained in the voting materials received by thedepositary and describing how you may instruct the depositary to exercise the voting rights for the shares which underlie your ADSs.For instructions to bevalid, the depositary must receive them in the manner and on or before the date specified.The depositary will try, as far as is practical, subject to theprovisions of and governing the underlying shares or other deposited securities, to vote or to have its agents vote the shares or other deposited securities asyou instruct.The depositary will only vote or attempt to vote as you instruct.If we timely requested the depositary to solicit your instructions but noinstructions are received by the depositary from a holder with respect to any of the deposited securities represented by the ADSs of that holder on or beforethe date established by the depositary for such purpose, the depositary shall deem that holder to have instructed the depositary to give a discretionary proxyto a person designated by us with respect to such deposited securities, and the depositary shall give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by us to votesuch deposited securities.However, no such instruction shall be deemed given and no such discretionary proxy shall be given with respect to any matter if weinform the depositary we do not wish such proxy given, substantial opposition exists or the matter materially and adversely affects the rights of holders of theordinary shares.Furthermore, neither the depositary nor its agents are responsible for any failure to carry out any voting instructions, for the manner in whichany vote is cast or for the effect of any vote.Notwithstanding anything contained in the deposit agreement or any ADR, the depositary may, to the extent notprohibited by law or regulations, or by the requirements of the stock exchange on which the ADSs are listed, in lieu of distribution of the materials providedto the depositary in connection with any meeting of, or solicitation of consents or proxies from, holders of deposited securities, distribute to the registeredholders of ADRs a notice that provides such holders with, or otherwise publicizes to such holders, instructions on how to retrieve such materials or receivesuch materials upon request (i.e., by reference to a website containing the materials for retrieval or a contact for requesting copies of the materials).185Table of Contents              Under our constituent documents the depositary would be able to provide us with voting instructions without having to personally attend meetingsin person or by proxy.Such voting instructions may be provided to us via facsimile, email, mail, courier or other recognized form of delivery and we agree toaccept any such delivery so long as it is timely received prior to the meeting.We will endeavor to provide the depositary with written notice of each meetingof shareholders promptly after determining the date of such meeting so as to enable it to solicit and receive voting instructions.In general, the depositary willrequire that voting instructions be received by the depositary no less than five business days prior to the date of each meeting of shareholders.Under ourcurrent memorandum and articles of association, the minimum notice period required to convene a general meeting is seven days.The depositary may nothave sufficient time to solicit voting instructions, and it is possible that you, or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties,will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote.Notwithstanding the above, we have advised the depositary that under the Cayman Islands law and our constituent documents, each as in effect as ofthe date of the deposit agreement, voting at any meeting of shareholders is by show of hands unless a poll is (before or on the declaration of the results of theshow of hands) demanded.In the event that voting on any resolution or matter is conducted on a show of hands basis in accordance with our constituentdocuments, the depositary will refrain from voting and the voting instructions (or the deemed voting instructions, as set out above) received by thedepositary from holders shall lapse.The depositary will not demand a poll or join in demanding a poll, whether or not requested to do so by holders of ADSs.There is no guarantee that you will receive voting materials in time to instruct the depositary to vote and it is possible that you, or persons who holdtheir ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote.Reports and Other CommunicationsWill ADR holders be able to view our reports?The depositary will make available for inspection by ADR holders at the offices of the depositary and the custodian the deposit agreement, theprovisions of or governing deposited securities, and any written communications from us which are both received by the custodian or its nominee as a holderof deposited securities and made generally available to the holders of deposited securities.Additionally, if we make any written communications generally available to holders of our shares, and we furnish copies thereof (or Englishtranslations or summaries) to the depositary, it will distribute the same to registered ADR holders.186Table of ContentsFees and ExpensesWhat fees and expenses will I be responsible for paying?As an ADS holder, you will be required to pay the following service fees to the depositary bank and certain taxes and governmental charges (inaddition to any applicable fees, expenses, taxes and other governmental charges payable on the deposited securities represented by any of your ADSs):              As an ADS holder, you will also be responsible to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by the depositary bank and certain taxes and governmentalcharges (in addition to any applicable fees, expenses, taxes and other governmental charges payable on the deposited securities represented by any of yourADSs) such as:•Fees for the transfer and registration of ordinary shares charged by the registrar and transfer agent for the ordinary shares in the Cayman Islands(i.e., upon deposit and withdrawal of ordinary shares).•Expenses incurred for converting foreign currency into U.S. dollars.•Expenses for cable, telex, fax and electronic transmissions and for delivery of securities.•Taxes and duties upon the transfer of securities, including any applicable stamp duties, any stock transfer charges or withholding taxes(i.e., when ordinary shares are

ADSs.•Fees and expenses incurred in connection with complying with exchange control regulations and other regulatory requirements applicable toordinary shares, deposited securities, ADSs and ADRs.The depositary fees payable upon the issuance and cancellation of ADSs are typically paid to the depositary bank by the brokers (on behalf of theirclients) receiving the newly issued ADSs from the depositary bank and by the brokers (on behalf of their clients) delivering the ADSs to the187Service Fees•to any person to whom ADSs are issued or to any person to whom adistribution is made in

bank for cancellation.The brokers in turn charge these fees to their clients.Depositary fees payable in connection with distributions of cash orsecurities to ADS holders and the depositary services fee are charged by the depositary bank to the holders of record of ADSs as of the applicable ADS recorddate.The depositary fees payable for cash distributions are generally deducted from the cash being distributed or by selling a portion of distributableproperty to pay the fees.In the case of distributions other than cash (i.e., share dividends, rights), the depositary bank charges the applicable fee to the ADSrecord date holders concurrent with the distribution.In the case of ADSs registered in the name of the investor (whether certificated or uncertificated in directregistration), the depositary bank sends invoices to the applicable record date ADS holders.In the case of ADSs held in brokerage and custodian accounts(via DTC), the depositary bank generally collects its fees through the systems provided by DTC (whose nominee is the registered holder of the ADSs held inDTC) from the brokers and custodians holding ADSs in their DTC accounts.The brokers and custodians who hold their clients' ADSs in DTC accounts in turncharge their clients' accounts the amount of the fees paid to the depositary banks.In the event of refusal to pay the depositary fees, the depositary bank may, under the terms of the deposit agreement, refuse the requested service untilpayment is received or may set off the amount of the depositary fees from any distribution to be made to the ADS holder.Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as depositary, has agreed to reimburse us for a portion of certain expenses we incur that are related toestablishment and maintenance of the ADR program, including investor relations expenses.There are limits on the amount of expenses for which thedepositary will reimburse us, but the amount of reimbursement available to us is not related to the amounts of fees the depositary collects from investors.Further, the depositary has agreed to reimburse us certain fees payable to the depositary by holders of ADSs.Neither the depositary nor we can determine theexact amount to be made available to us because (i) the number of ADSs that will be issued and outstanding, (ii) the level of service fees to be charged toholders of ADSs and (iii) our reimbursable expenses related to the program are not known at this time.Payment of Taxes              You will be responsible for any taxes or other governmental charges payable on your ADSs or on the deposited securities represented by any of yourADSs.The depositary may refuse to register any transfer of your ADSs or allow you to withdraw the deposited securities represented by your ADSs until suchtaxes or other charges are paid.It may apply payments owed to you or sell deposited securities represented by your ADSs to pay any taxes owed and you willremain liable for any deficiency.If the depositary sells deposited securities, it will, if appropriate, reduce the number of ADSs to reflect the sale and pay toyou any net proceeds, or send to you any property, remaining after it has paid the taxes.You agree to indemnify us, the depositary, the custodian and each ofour and their respective agents, directors, employees and affiliates for, and hold each of them harmless from, any claims with respect to taxes (includingapplicable interest and penalties thereon) arising from any refund of taxes, reduced rate of withholding or other tax benefit obtained for you.Your obligationsunder this paragraph shall survive any transfer of any ADRs, any surrender of ADRs and withdrawal of deposited securities or the termination of the depositagreement.Reclassifications, Recapitalizations and Mergers              If we take certain actions that affect the deposited securities, including (i) any change in par value, split-up, consolidation, cancellation or otherreclassification of deposited securities or (ii) any distributions not made to holders of ADRs or (iii) any recapitalization, reorganization, merger,188Table of Contentsconsolidation, liquidation, receivership, bankruptcy or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, then the depositary may choose to:•distribute additional or amended ADRs; •distribute cash, securities or other property it has received in connection with such actions; •sell any securities or property received and distribute the proceeds as cash; or •none of the above.Any of the cash, securities or other property the depositary receives will constitute part of the deposited securities and each ADS will then represent aproportionate interest in such property.Amendment and TerminationHow may the deposit agreement be amended?We may agree with the depositary to amend the deposit agreement and the ADSs without your consent for any reason.ADR holders must be given atleast 30 days notice of any amendment that imposes or increases any fees or charges (other than stock transfer or other taxes and other governmental charges,transfer or registration fees, cable, telex or facsimile transmission costs, delivery costs or other such expenses), or otherwise prejudices any substantialexisting right of ADR holders.Such notice need not describe in detail the specific amendments effectuated thereby, but must give ADR holders a means toaccess the text of such amendment.If an ADR holder continues to hold an ADR or ADRs after being so notified, such ADR holder is deemed to agree to suchamendment and to be bound by the deposit agreement as so amended.Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any governmental body or regulatory body shouldadopt new laws, rules or regulations which would require amendment or supplement of the deposit agreement or the form of ADR to ensure compliancetherewith, we and the depositary may amend or supplement the deposit agreement and the ADR at any time in accordance with such changed laws, rules orregulations, which amendment or supplement may take effect before a notice is given or within any other period of time as required for compliance.Noamendment, however, will impair your right to surrender your ADSs and receive the underlying securities, except in order to comply with mandatoryprovisions of applicable law.How may the deposit agreement be terminated?The depositary shall at our written direction, terminate the deposit agreement and the ADRs by mailing notice of such termination to the registeredholders of ADRs at least 60 days prior to the date fixed in such notice for such termination; provided, however, if the depositary shall have (i) resigned asdepositary under the deposit agreement, notice of such termination by the depositary shall not be provided to registered holders unless a successor depositaryshall not be operating under the deposit agreement within 30 days of the date of such resignation, and (ii) been removed as depositary under the depositagreement, notice of such termination by the depositary shall not be provided to registered holders of ADRs unless a successor depositary shall not beoperating under the deposit agreement on the 90th day after our notice of removal was first provided to the depositary.After termination, the depositary'sonly responsibility will be (i) to deliver deposited securities to ADR holders who surrender their ADRs, and (ii) to hold or sell distributions received ondeposited securities.Six months or more after the termination date, the depositary will sell the deposited securities which remain and hold the net proceeds ofsuch sales (as long as it may lawfully do so), without liability for interest, in trust for the ADR holders who have not yet surrendered their ADRs.After makingsuch sale, the depositary shall have no obligations except to account for such proceeds and other cash.After termination, our only obligations will beongoing indemnity and any fee obligations to the depositary.189Table of

FOR FUTURE SALES               Upon completion of this offering, we will have                        ADSs outstanding, representing approximately            % of our total outstanding ordinaryshares, assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs.All of the ADSs sold in this offering will be freely transferable bypersons other than by our \"affiliates\" without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act.Sales of substantial amounts of our ADSs in the publicmarket could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our ADSs.Although our ADSs are listed on NASDAQ, we cannot assure you that a regular tradingmarket for our ADSs will sustain or continue to exist.We do not expect that a trading market will develop for our ordinary shares not represented by theADSs.Lock-up Agreements              In connection with our initial public offering, we, our directors and executive officers, and our then existing shareholders have agreed, subject tosome exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale, lend or otherwise dispose of, except in thisoffering, any of our ordinary shares or ADSs or securities that are substantially similar to our ordinary shares or ADSs, including but not limited to anyoptions or warrants to purchase our ordinary shares, ADSs or any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive,our ordinary shares, ADSs or any such substantially similar securities (other than pursuant to employee stock option plans existing on, or upon theconversion or exchange of convertible or exchangeable securities outstanding as of, the date such lock-up agreement was executed), without the prior writtenconsent of the representatives of the underwriters, for a period of 180 days after May 21, 2014, subject to automatic extension under certain circumstances.The locked-up parties collectively owned all of our outstanding ordinary shares at the time, without giving effect to our initial public offering.In connectionwith this offering, the representatives of the underwriters have waived those lock-up provisions with respect to the shares being sold by the sellingshareholders in this offering.The remaining shares will continue to be subject to those lock-up provisions during the 180-day period, which will end onDecember 5, 2014 due to an extension pursuant to the lock-up agreements.In addition, Huang River Investment Limited, a company wholly owned by Tencent Holdings Limited, continues to be subject to the lock-upobligations in connection with its investment in our company pursuant to which it has agreed not to sell or transfer any of our shares it holds during the three-year period commencing from March 10, 2014, subject to limited exceptions.Additionally, we, Max Smart Limited, a company wholly owned by Mr. Richard Qiangdong Liu, our founder, chairman and chief executive

ordinary shares, or the availability of ADSs or ordinary shares for future sale, will have on the trading price ofour ADSs from time to time.Sales of substantial amounts of our ADSs or ordinary shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur,could adversely affect the trading price of our ADSs.Rule 144              \"Restricted securities\" as that term is defined in

701 shares would remain subject to lock-up arrangements and would only become eligible forsale when the lock-up period expires.195Table of ContentsTAXATION               The following summary of the principal Cayman Islands, PRC and U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in our ADSs or ordinaryshares is based upon laws and relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date of this prospectus, all of which are subject to change.This summarydoes not deal with all possible tax consequences relating to an investment in our ADSs or ordinary shares, such as the tax consequences under U.S. stateand local tax laws or under the tax laws of jurisdictions other than the Cayman Islands, the People's Republic of China and the United States.To the extentthat the discussion relates to matters of Cayman Islands tax law, it represents the opinion of Maples and Calder, our special Cayman Islands counsel; to theextent it relates to PRC tax law, it is the opinion of Zhong Lun Law Firm, our special PRC counsel; and to the extent that the discussion states specific legalconclusions under U.S. federal income tax law as to the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in our ADSs or ordinary shares,and subject to the qualifications herein, it represents the opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, our special United States counsel.Cayman Islands Taxation              The Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is notaxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty.There are no other taxes likely to be material to us levied by the government of the Cayman Islandsexcept for stamp duties which may be applicable on instruments executed in, or after execution brought within the jurisdiction of, the Cayman Islands.TheCayman Islands is not party to any double tax treaties which are applicable to any payments made by or to our company.There are no exchange controlregulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands.There is no income tax treaty or convention currently in effect between the United States and the Cayman Islands.People's Republic of China Taxation              Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with \"de facto managementbody\" within the PRC is considered a resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income tax on its global income at the rate of 25%.Theimplementation rules define the term \"de facto management body\" as the body that exercises full and substantial control and overall management over thebusiness, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise.In 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued a circular, known as Circular82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the \"de facto management body\" of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporatedoffshore is located in China.Although this circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not thosecontrolled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the State Administration of Taxation's general position on howthe \"de facto management body\" text should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises.According to Circular 82, an offshoreincorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its \"de factomanagement body\" in China only if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC;(ii) decisions relating to the enterprise's financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC;(iii) the enterprise's primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in thePRC; and (iv) at least 50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC.We believe that none of JD.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes.JD.com, Inc. is notcontrolled by a PRC enterprise or PRC enterprise196Table of Contentsgroup and we do not believe that JD.com, Inc. meets all of the conditions above.JD.com, Inc. is a company incorporated outside the PRC.As a holdingcompany, its key assets are its ownership interests in its subsidiaries, and its key assets are located, and its records (including the resolutions of its board ofdirectors and the resolutions of its shareholders) are maintained, outside the PRC.For the same reasons, we believe our other subsidiaries outside of China arenot PRC resident enterprises either.However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertaintiesremain with respect to the interpretation of the term \"de facto management body.\"If the PRC tax authorities determine that JD.com, Inc. is a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, we may be required to withholda 10% withholding tax from dividends we pay to our shareholders that are non-resident enterprises, including the holders of our ADSs.In addition, non-resident enterprise shareholders (including our ADS holders) may be subject to a 10% PRC withholding tax on gains realized on the sale or other dispositionof ADSs or ordinary shares, if such income is treated as sourced from within the PRC.It is unclear whether our non-PRC individual shareholders (includingour ADS holders) would be subject to any PRC tax on dividends or gains obtained by such non-PRC individual shareholders in the event we are determinedto be a PRC resident enterprise.If any PRC tax were to apply to dividends or gains realized by non-PRC individuals, it would generally apply at a rate of20% unless a reduced rate is available under an applicable tax treaty.However, it is also unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of JD.com, Inc. would be ableto claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that JD.com, Inc. is treated as a PRC residententerprise.Provided that our Cayman Islands holding company, JD.com, Inc., is not deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise, holders of our ADSs and ordinaryshares who are not PRC residents will not be subject to PRC income tax on dividends distributed by us or gains realized from the sale or other disposition ofour shares or ADSs.However, under SAT Circular 698, where a non-resident enterprise transfers the equity interests of a PRC resident enterprise indirectly bydisposition of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, or Indirect Transfer, and such overseas holding company is located in certain low taxjurisdictions, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, must report this Indirect Transfer to the relevant tax authority of the PRC resident enterprise.The PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for thepurpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax.As a result, gains derived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of up to 10%.Although it appears that SAT Circular 698 was not intended to apply to share transfers of publicly traded companies, there is uncertainty as to the applicationof SAT Circular 698 and we and our non-PRC resident investors may be at risk of being required to file a return and being taxed under SAT Circular 698and we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with SAT Circular 698 or to establish that we should not be taxed under SAT Circular 698.See \"Risks Related to Doing Business in China—We face uncertainties with respect to the application of the Circular on Strengthening the Administration ofEnterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises.\"United States Federal Income Tax Considerations              The following is a discussion of the principal United States federal income tax considerations relating to the acquisition, ownership, and dispositionof our ADSs or ordinary shares by a U.S. Holder (as defined below) that will hold our ADSs or ordinary shares as \"capital assets\" (generally, property held forinvestment) under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\").This discussion is based upon existing United States federaltax law, which is subject to differing interpretations or change, possibly with retroactive effect.This discussion does not address all aspects of United Statesfederal income taxation that may be important to particular investors in light of their individual investment circumstances, including investors subject tospecial tax rules (for197Table of Contentsexample, certain financial institutions, insurance companies, broker-dealers, traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment, partnerships and theirpartners, tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations), investors who are not U.S. Holders, investors who own (directly, indirectly, orconstructively) 10% or more of our voting stock, investors that will hold their ADSs or ordinary shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructivesale, or other integrated transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, or investors that have a functional currency other than the United Statesdollar), all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those summarized below.In addition, this discussion does not address any state, local or non-United States tax considerations (other than the discussion below relating tocertain withholding rules and the United States—PRC income tax treaty).Each U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the United Statesfederal, state, local, and non-United States income and other tax considerations of an investment in ADSs or ordinary shares.General              For purposes of this discussion, a \"U.S. Holder\" is a beneficial owner of our ADSs or ordinary shares that is, for United States federal income taxpurposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for United States federalincome tax purposes) created in, or organized under the law of, the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income ofwhich is includible in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust (A) the administration of which issubject to the primary supervision of a United States court and which has one or more United States persons who have the authority to control all substantialdecisions of the trust or (B) that has otherwise elected to be treated as a United States person under the Code.If a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) owns our ADSs or ordinary shares, the taxtreatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.Partnerships holding ourADSs or ordinary shares and their partners are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding an investment in our ADSs or ordinary shares.Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations              A non-United States corporation, such as our company, will be classified as a \"passive foreign investment company,\" or PFIC, for United States federalincome tax purposes for any taxable year, if either (i) 75% or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of \"passive\" income or (ii) 50% ormore of the value of its assets (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year produce or are held for the production of passive income.Forthis purpose, cash is categorized as a passive asset and the company's unbooked intangibles associated with active business activity are taken into account asa non-passive asset.The average percentage of a corporation's assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income generally is determined onthe basis of the fair market value of the corporation's assets at the end of each quarter.This determination is based on the adjusted tax basis of thecorporation's assets, however, if the corporation is a controlled foreign corporation, or CFC, that is not a publicly traded corporation for the taxable year.Wewould be treated as a CFC for any year on any day in which U.S. Holders each own (directly, indirectly or by attribution) at least 10% of our voting sharesand together own more than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting shares or more than 50% of the total value of all of ourshares.If we are treated as a CFC for United States federal income tax purposes for any portion of our taxable year that includes this offering, we would likelybe classified as a PFIC for our taxable year ending December 31, 2014.The CFC determination involves a highly complex and technical factual analysis and,in certain cases such as our own, potentially cannot be made with complete certainty.198Table of ContentsHowever, although no assurances can be made in this regard because of these complexities, based on our shareholder composition during the taxable yearending December 31, 2014, we believe that we were not, and we do not expect to be, a CFC for any portion of the taxable year of the offering.In addition, we will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets and earning a proportionate share of the income of any other corporationin which we own, directly or indirectly, more than 25% (by value) of the stock.Although the law in this regard is unclear, we treat our VIEs as being ownedby us for United States federal income tax purposes because we control their management decisions and we are entitled to substantially all of the economicbenefits associated with these entities, and, as a result, we consolidate their results of operations in our U.S. GAAP financial statements and treat them asbeing owned by us for United States federal income tax purposes.If it were determined, however, that that we are not the owner of our VIEs for United Statesfederal income tax purposes, we may be treated as a PFIC for our current taxable year and in future taxable years.Subject to the foregoing uncertainties, based on our current income and assets and the value of our ADSs and outstanding ordinary shares, we do notexpect to be classified as a PFIC for our taxable year ending December 31, 2014 or in the foreseeable future.While we do not anticipate becoming a PFICfollowing the year of the offering, changes in the nature of our income or assets, or fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs or ordinary shares, may causeus to become a PFIC for future taxable years.In estimating the value of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, we have taken into account marketcapitalization, which may fluctuate over time.Among other factors, if our market capitalization subsequently declines, we may be or become classified as aPFIC for the current or future taxable years.Under circumstances where revenues from activities that produce passive income significantly increase relative toour revenues from activities that produce non-passive income or where we determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for working capital or otherpurposes, our risk of becoming classified as a PFIC may substantially increase.If we are classified as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or ordinary shares, the PFIC tax rules discussed belowunder \"—Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules\" generally will apply to such U.S. Holder for such taxable year and, unless the U.S. Holder makescertain elections, will apply in future years even if we cease to be a PFIC.The discussion below under \"—Dividends\" and \"—Sale or Other Disposition ofADSs or Ordinary Shares\" assumes that we will not be classified as a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes.Dividends              Any cash distributions (including any amount of any PRC tax withheld) paid on our ADSs or ordinary shares out of our current or accumulatedearnings and profits, as determined under United States federal income tax principles, will generally be includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder asdividend income on the day actually or constructively received by the U.S. Holder, in the case of ordinary shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADSs.Because we do not intend to determine our earnings and profits on the basis of United States federal income tax principles, any distribution we pay willgenerally be treated as a \"dividend\" for United States federal income tax purposes.Dividends received on our ADSs or ordinary shares will not be eligible forthe dividends received deduction allowed to corporations under the Code.A non-corporate recipient will be subject to tax at the lower capital gain tax rate applicable to \"qualified dividend income\" on dividends paid on ourADSs, provided that certain conditions are satisfied, including that (1) our ADSs are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States,or, in the event that we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC tax law, we are eligible for the benefit of the United States-PRC income taxtreaty (the \"Treaty\"), (2) we are neither a passive foreign investment company nor treated as such with respect to a U.S. Holder (as199Table of Contentsdiscussed below) for the taxable year in which the dividend was paid and the preceding taxable year, and (3) certain holding period requirements are met.Because we do not expect our ordinary shares will be listed on an established securities market, we do not believe that dividends we pay on our ordinaryshares that are not represented by ADSs will meet the conditions required for such reduced tax rates, unless we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise (asdescribed above).In the event that we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, a U.S. Holder may be subject toPRC taxes on dividends paid on our ADSs or ordinary shares.We may, however, be eligible for the benefits of the United States-PRC income tax treaty.If weare eligible for such benefits, dividends we pay on our ordinary shares, regardless of whether such shares are represented by the ADSs, would be eligible forthe reduced rates of taxation described in the preceding paragraph.For United States foreign tax credit purposes, dividends generally will be treated as income from foreign sources and generally will constitute passivecategory income.A U.S. Holder may be eligible, subject to a number of complex limitations, to claim a foreign tax credit not in excess of any applicabletreaty rate in respect of any foreign withholding taxes imposed on dividends received on our ADSs or ordinary shares.A U.S. Holder who does not elect toclaim a foreign tax credit for foreign tax withheld may instead claim a deduction, for United States federal income tax purposes, in respect of suchwithholding, but only for a year in which such holder elects to do so for all creditable foreign income taxes.The rules governing the foreign tax credit arecomplex.U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances.Sale or Other Disposition of ADSs or Ordinary Shares              A U.S. Holder will generally recognize capital gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares in an amount equal to thedifference between the amount realized upon the sale or other disposition and the holder's adjusted tax basis in such ADSs or ordinary shares.Any capitalgain or loss will be long-term if the ADSs or ordinary shares have been held for more than one year and will generally be United States-source gain or loss forUnited States foreign tax credit purposes.However, in the event that gain from the disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares is subject to tax in the PRCbecause we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise, a U.S. Holder may be able to elect to treat such gain as PRC-source gain.The deductibility of a capitalloss may be subject to limitations.U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if a foreign tax is imposed on adisposition of our ADSs or ordinary shares, including the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances.Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules              If we are classified as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or ordinary shares, and unless the U.S. Holder makes a\"mark-to-market\" election (as described below), the U.S. Holder will generally be subject to special tax rules that have a penalizing effect, regardless ofwhether we remain a PFIC, on (i) any excess distribution that we make to the U.S. Holder (which generally means any distribution paid during a taxable yearto a U.S. Holder that is greater than 125 percent of the average annual distributions paid in the three preceding taxable years or, if shorter, the U.S. Holder'sholding period for the ADSs or ordinary shares), and (ii) any gain realized on the sale or other disposition, including a pledge, of ADSs or ordinary shares.Under the PFIC rules:•the excess distribution or gain will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder's holding period for the ADSs or ordinary shares;200Table of Contents•amounts allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable years in a U.S. Holder's holding period prior to the first taxable year in which weare classified as a PFIC (a \"pre-PFIC year\") will be taxable as ordinary income; and •amounts allocated to each prior taxable year, other than the current taxable year or a pre-PFIC year, will be subject to tax at the highest tax ratein effect applicable to such U.S. Holder for that year, and such amounts will be increased by an additional tax equal to interest on the resultingtax deemed deferred with respect to such years.If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or ordinary shares and any of our subsidiaries is also a PFIC, suchU.S.Holder would be treated as owning a proportionate amount (by value) of the shares of the lower-tier PFIC for purposes of the application of these rules.U.S.Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to any of our subsidiaries.As an alternative to the foregoing rules, a U.S. Holder of \"marketable stock\" in a PFIC may make a mark-to-market election with respect to our ADSs,but not our ordinary shares, provided that our ADSs remained listed on NASDAQ and that the ADSs are regularly traded.We anticipate that our ADSs shouldqualify as being regularly traded, but no assurances may be given in this regard.If a U.S. Holder makes this election, the holder will generally (i) include asordinary income for each taxable year that we are a PFIC the excess, if any, of the fair market value of ADSs held at the end of the taxable year over theadjusted tax basis of such ADSs and (ii) deduct as an ordinary loss the excess, if any, of the adjusted tax basis of the ADSs over the fair market value of suchADSs held at the end of the taxable year, but such deduction will only be allowed to the extent of the amount previously included in income as a result of themark-to-market election.The U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the ADSs would be adjusted to reflect any income or loss resulting from the mark-to-marketelection.If a U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election in respect of our ADSs and we cease to be a PFIC, the holder will not be required to take intoaccount the gain or loss described above during any period that we are not classified as a PFIC.If a U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election, any gainsuch U.S. Holder recognizes upon the sale or other disposition of our ADSs in a year when we are a PFIC will be treated as ordinary income and any loss willbe treated as ordinary loss, but such loss will only be treated as ordinary loss to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of themark-to-market election.Because, as a technical matter, a mark-to-market election cannot be made for any lower-tier PFICs that we may own, a U.S. Holder may continue to besubject to the general PFIC rules described above with respect to such U.S. Holder's indirect interest in any investments held by us that are treated as anequity interest in a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes.A U.S. Holder that holds ADSs or ordinary shares in any year in which we are classified as a PFIC may make a \"deemed sale\" election with respect tosuch ADSs or ordinary shares in a subsequent taxable year in which we are not classified as a PFIC.If a U.S. Holder makes a valid deemed sale election withrespect to such ADSs or ordinary shares, such U.S. Holder will be treated as having sold all of its ADSs or ordinary shares for their fair market value on the lastday of the last taxable year in which we were a PFIC and such ADSs or ordinary shares will no longer be treated as PFIC stock.A U.S. Holder will recognizegain (but not loss), which will be subject to tax as an 'excess distribution' received on the last day of the last taxable year in which we were a PFIC.A U.S.Holder's basis in the ADSs or ordinary shares would be increased to reflect gain recognized, and such U.S. Holder's holding period would begin on the dayafter we ceased to be a PFIC.The deemed sale election is only relevant to U.S. Holders that hold the ADSs or ordinary shares during a taxable year in which we cease to be a PFIC.U.S.Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the advisability of making a deemed sale election and the consequences thereof in light of theU.S.Holder's individual circumstances.201Table of Contents              We do not intend to provide information necessary for U.S. Holders to make qualified electing fund elections which, if available, would result in taxtreatment different from the tax treatment for PFICs described above.If a U.S. Holder owns our ADSs or ordinary shares during any taxable year that we are a PFIC, the holder must file an annual Internal Revenue ServiceForm 8621.Each U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisor concerning the United States federal income tax consequences of purchasing, holding, anddisposing of ADSs or ordinary shares if we are or become classified as a PFIC, including the possibility of making a mark-to-market election and theunavailability of the qualified electing fund election.Medicare Tax              An additional 3.8% tax is imposed on a portion or all of the net investment income of certain individuals with a modified adjusted gross income ofover $200,000 (or $250,000 in the case of joint filers or $125,000 in the case of married individuals filing separately) and on the undistributed netinvestment income of certain estates and trusts.For these purposes, \"net investment income\" generally includes interest, dividends (including dividends paidwith respect to our ADSs or ordinary shares), annuities, royalties, rents, net gain attributable to the disposition of property not held in a trade or business(including net gain from the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of an ADS or ordinary share) and certain other income, reduced by any deductionsproperly allocable to such income or net gain.U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the applicability of this tax to their income andgains in respect of an investment in the ADSs or ordinary shares.Backup Withholding and Information Reporting              Individual U.S. Holders and certain entities may be required to submit to the IRS certain information with respect to his or her beneficial ownership ofthe ADSs or ordinary shares, if such ADSs or ordinary shares are not held on his or her behalf by a financial institution.This new law also imposes penalties ifan individual U.S. Holder is required to submit such information to the IRS and fails to do so.Proceeds from the sale, exchange or other disposition of, or a distribution on, the ADSs or ordinary shares may be subject to information reporting tothe IRS and possible backup withholding.Backup withholding generally will not apply, however, to a U.S. Holder who furnishes a correct taxpayeridentification number and makes any other required certification or who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding.U.S. Holders who are required toestablish their exempt status generally must provide such certification on IRS Form W-9.Backup withholding is not an additional tax.Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules generally will be allowed as a refund or acredit against a U.S. Holder's United States federal income tax liability if the required information is furnished by the U.S. Holder on a timely basis to the IRS.Each U.S. Holder is encouraged to consult its own tax advisor regarding the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules.202Table of

listed on NASDAQ under the symbol \"JD.\"The underwriters do not expect to sell more than 5% of the ADSs in the aggregate to accounts over which they exercise discretionary authority.Price Stabilization, Short Positions and Penalty Bids              Until the distribution of the ADSs is completed, SEC rules may limit underwriters and selling group members from bidding for and purchasing ourADSs.However, the representatives may engage in transactions that stabilize the price of the ADSs, such as bids or purchases to peg, fix or maintain thatprice.In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell our ADSs in the open market.These transactions may include short sales,purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales and stabilizing transactions.Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of agreater number of ADSs than they are required to purchase in the offering.\"Covered\" short sales are sales made in an amount not greater than the underwriters'option to purchase additional ADSs described above.The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchaseadditional ADSs or purchasing ADSs in the open market.In determining the source of ADSs to close out the covered short position, the underwriters willconsider, among other things, the price of ADSs available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase ADSs throughthe option granted to them.\"Naked\" short sales are sales in excess of such option.The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasingADSs in the open market.A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on theprice of our ADSs in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.Stabilizing transactions consist ofvarious bids for or purchases of ADSs made by the underwriters in the open market prior to the completion of the offering.The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid.This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwritingdiscount received by it because the representatives have repurchased ADSs sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short coveringtransactions.Similar to other purchase transactions, the underwriters' purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining themarket price of our ADSs or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our ADSs.As a result, the price of our ADSs may be higher than the pricethat might otherwise exist in the open market.The underwriters may conduct these transactions on NASDAQ, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.Neither we nor any of the underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactionsdescribed above may have on the price of our ADSs.In addition, neither we nor any of the underwriters make any representation that the representatives willengage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.The address of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated is One Bryant Park, New York, New York 10036, United

option agreement and equity pledge agreement relating to Jingdong 360 were amendedand restated, and their contract terms were extended to April 15, 2021 to reflect the increase of registered capital

and Jiangsu Yuanzhou granted another irrevocable power of attorney on May 29, 2012 toJingdong Century or representative designated by Jingdong Century, upon which no terms or conditions of the original power of attorney was changed oraltered.On November 6, 2012, the loan agreement, exclusive purchase option agreement, equity pledge agreement and power of attorney relating to JiangsuYuanzhou

or altered.OnDecember 18 and 25, 2013, the intellectual property rights license agreement relating to Jiangsu Yuanzhou and Jingdong 360 were amended and restated andtheir contractual term were extended to December 18 and 25, 2023, respectively to include 3 other subsidiaries of Jingdong Century as service providers.Noother terms or conditions of the original agreements were changed or altered.Risks in relations to the VIE structure              In the opinion of management, Jingdong Century's contractual arrangements with Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou and the NomineeShareholders are in compliance with PRC laws and regulations and are legally binding and enforceable.The Nominee Shareholders are also shareholders ornominees of shareholders of the Company and therefore have no current interest in seeking to act contrary to the contractual arrangements.However, there aresubstantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations including those that govern the Group's contractualarrangements, which could limit the Group's ability to enforce these contractual arrangements and if the Nominee Shareholders of the VIEs were to reducetheir interests in the Company, their interest may diverge from that of the Company and that may potentially increase the risk that they would seek to actcontrary to the contractual arrangements.The Company's ability toF-14Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)1.Principal activities and organization (Continued)control the VIEs also depends on the power of attorney Jingdong Century has to vote on all matters requiring shareholder approval in the VIEs.As notedabove, the Company believes these power of attorney are legally enforceable but may not be as effective as direct equity ownership.In addition, if theGroup's corporate structure and contractual arrangements with Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou through which the Group conducts its business in PRCwere found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws and regulations, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities could:•revoke or refuse to grant or renew the Group's business and operating licenses; •restrict or prohibit related party transactions between Jingdong Century and its subsidiaries, Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou; •impose fines, confiscate income or other requirements which the Group may find difficult or impossible to comply with; •require the Group to alter the corporate structure operations; and •restrict or prohibit the Group's ability to finance its operations.The imposition of any of these government actions could result in a material adverse effect on the Group's ability to conduct its operations.In suchcase, the Group may not be able to operate or control Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou, which may result in deconsolidation of Jingdong 360 andJiangsu Yuanzhou in the Group's consolidated financial statements.In the opinion of management, the likelihood for the Company to lose such ability isremote based on current facts and circumstances.The Company's operations depend on the VIEs to honor their contractual agreements with the Company.Almost all of these agreements are governed by PRC law and disputes arising out of these agreements are expected to be decided by arbitration in China.Themanagement believes that each of the contractual agreements constitutes valid and legally binding obligations of each party to such contractual agreementsunder PRC Laws.However, the interpretation and implementation of the laws and regulations in the PRC and their application to an effect on the legality,binding effect and enforceability of contracts are subject to the discretion of competent PRC authorities, and therefore there is no assurance that relevant PRCauthorities will take the same position as the Group herein in respect of the legality, binding effect and enforceability of each of the contractual agreements.Meanwhile, since the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform andenforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to the Company to enforce the contractualarrangements should the VIEs or the Nominee Shareholders of the VIEs fail to perform their obligations under those arrangements.F-15Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Consolidated

2011, 2012 and 2013, the total assets of Group's VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries were mainly consisting of cash and cash equivalents,accounts receivable, inventories, prepayments and other current assets and intangible assets.As of December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, the total liabilities ofVIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries were mainly consisting of accounts payable and liabilities to the Group's other subsidiaries.These balances have been reflected inthe Group's consolidated financial statements with intercompany transactions eliminated.In accordance with the Contractual Agreements, Jingdong Century has the power to direct activities of the Group's VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries, andcan have assets transferred out of the Group's VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries.Therefore, Jingdong Century considers that there is no asset in the Group's VIEs andVIEs' subsidiaries that can be used only to settle their obligations except for registered capitals of Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou amounting toRMB44,000 as of December 31, 2013.As the Group's VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries are incorporated as limited liability companies under the PRC CompanyLaw, the creditors do not have recourse to

RMB20,915, RMB175,092 and RMB357,236 as of December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013,respectively.Currently there is no contractual arrangement that could require Jingdong Century or the Group to provide additional financial support to Jingdong360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou.As the Group is conducting certain businesses in the PRC through Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou, the Group may provideadditional financial support on a discretionary basis in the future, which could expose the Group to a loss.There is no VIE where the Company or any subsidiary has a variable interest but is not the primary beneficiary.Liquidity              The Group has been incurring recurring losses from operations since inception.Accumulated deficit amounted to RMB2,481,604, RMB4,212,915and RMB4,263,624 as of December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.The net cash used in operating activities was approximately RMB86,391 for theyear ended December 31, 2011.The net cash provided by operating activities was approximately RMB1,403,652 and RMB3,569,819 for the year endedDecember 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively.The Group's liquidity is based on its ability to generate cash to fund its operations, its ability to attract investors and its ability to borrow funds onfavorable economic terms.Historically, the Group has relied principally on both operational sources of cash and non-operational sources of financing frominvestors to fund its operations and capital expansion needs, including construction of office buildings and warehouses.The Group's ability to continue as agoing concern is dependent on management's ability to successfully execute its business plan, which includes increasing revenues while controllingoperating expenses, as well as, generating operational cash flows, and continued support from outside sources of financing.The Group believes its currentcash balance will be sufficient to meet the Group's operating cash needs for the period of twelve months from the balance sheet date.In addition, if the Groupsuccessfully completed a qualified initial public offering (see Note 18) at any time before January 1, 2014 (which has been deferred to January 1, 2015 uponthe Group's request in December 2013), thereby triggering the automatic conversion of Series C Preferred Shares into ordinary shares and eliminating anyfuture cash outflow as a result of Series C Preferred Shares redemption.Based on the above considerations, the Group's consolidated financial statements havebeen prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities during the normal course of operations.2.Summary of significant accounting policiesa.Basis of presentation              The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in theUnited States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").Significant accounting policies followed by the Group in the preparation of the accompanying consolidatedfinancial statements are summarized below.F-17Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)2.Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)b.Principles of consolidation              The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.The consolidated financial statements includethe financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries, the VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries for which the Company is the ultimate primary beneficiary.Subsidiaries are those entities in which the Company, directly or indirectly, controls more than one half of the voting power or has the power to govern thefinancial and operating policies, to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors, or to cast a majority of votes at the meetingof directors.A VIE is an entity in which the Company, or its subsidiary, through contractual arrangements, bears the risks of, and enjoys the rewards normallyassociated with ownership of the entity, and therefore the Company or its subsidiary is the primary beneficiary of the entity.All transactions and balances among the Company, its subsidiaries, the VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation.c.Use of estimates              The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions thataffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related disclosures of contingent liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the reported revenues andexpenses during the reported period in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.Significant accounting estimates are used for, but notlimited to, sales returns, vendor and customer incentives, the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation arrangements, realization of deferred taxassets, fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, assessment for impairment of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill,allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation for excess and obsolete inventories, lower of cost and market value of inventories, depreciable lives ofproperty, equipment and software, useful life of intangible assets and redemption value of the redeemable preferred shares.Actual results may differmaterially from those estimates.d.Foreign currency translation              The Group's reporting currency is Renminbi (\"RMB\").The functional currency of the Group's entities incorporated in Cayman Islands, British VirginIslands (\"BVI\") and Hong Kong (\"HK\") is the United States dollars (\"US$\").The Group's PRC subsidiaries, VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries determined theirfunctional currency to be RMB.The determination of the respective functional currency is based on the criteria of ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters.Transactions denominated in currencies other than functional currency are translated into functional currency at the exchange rates quoted byauthoritative banks prevailing at the dates of the transactions.Exchange gains and losses resulting from those foreign currency transactions denominated in acurrency other than the functional currency are recorded as a component of Others, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and ComprehensiveLoss.Total exchange gains were RMB41,309, RMB13,762 and RMB92,761 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.F-18Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)2.Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)              The financial statements of the Group are translated from the functional currency into RMB.Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currenciesare translated into RMB using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet date.Equity accounts other than earnings generated in current period aretranslated into RMB at the appropriate historical rates.Revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated into RMB using the periodic average exchangerates.The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in theConsolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders' Equity.Total foreign currency translation adjustment losses were RMB141,493, RMB7,546 andRMB137,921 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.The grant-date fair value of the Group's share-based awards is reported inUS$ as the respective valuation is conducted on US$ basis.e.Convenience translation              Translations of balances in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss and ConsolidatedStatements of Cash Flows from RMB into US$ as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 are solely for the convenience of the readers and werecalculated at the rate of US$1.00=RMB6.0537, representing the noon buying rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board onDecember 31, 2013.No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into US$ at that rate onDecember 31, 2013, or at any other rate.f.Cash and cash equivalents              Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, time deposits, as well as highly liquid investments, some of which are subject to certain penalty asto early withdrawal, which have original maturities of three months or less.g.Restricted cash              Cash that is restricted as to withdrawal for use or pledged as security is reported separately on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and is notincluded in the total cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.The Group's restricted cash mainly represents (a) the secureddeposits held in designated bank accounts for issuance of bank acceptance and letter of guarantee; (b) time deposit that are pledged for short term loan; and(c) deposits held in designated bank accounts for capital verification for the establishment of new entities.h.Short-term investments              The Group classifies the short-term investment in debt securities as \"available-for-sale\".The Group made certain deposits with variable interest ratesor principal not-guaranteed with certain financial institutions.These investments were recorded at fair market value with the unrealized gains or lossesrecorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders' Equity.Realized gains arereflected as a component of interest income.In addition, short-term investments also comprise of time deposits placed with banks with original maturities longer than three months but less thanone year.F-19Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)2.Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)              The Group assesses whether there are any other-than-temporary impairment to its short-term investments due to declines in fair value or other marketconditions.Declines in fair values that are considered other-than-temporary are recorded as an impairment loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operationsand Comprehensive Loss.No impairment losses were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013.i.Accounts receivable, net              Accounts receivables mainly represent amounts due from customers and online payment channels and are recorded net of allowance for doubtfulaccounts.The Group considers many factors in assessing the collectability of its accounts receivable, such as the age of the amounts due, the customer'spayment history, credit-worthiness, financial conditions of the customers and industry trend.An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in the period inwhich a loss is determined to be probable.The Group also makes specific allowance if there is strong evidence indicating that the accounts receivable islikely to be unrecoverable.Accounts receivable balances are written off after all collection efforts have been exhausted.j.Inventories, net              Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are stated at the lower of cost or market value.Cost of inventory is determined using theweighted average cost method.Adjustments are recorded to write down the cost of inventory to the estimated market value due to slow-moving merchandiseand damaged goods, which is dependent upon factors such as historical and forecasted consumer demand, and promotional environment.The Group takesownership, risks and rewards of the products purchased, but has arrangements to return unsold goods with certain vendors.Write downs are recorded in cost ofrevenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.The Group also provides fulfillment-related services in connection with the Group's online marketplace.Third-party sellers maintain ownership oftheir inventories and therefore these products are not included in the Group's inventories.k.Equity investments              The Group accounts for an equity investment over which it has significant influence but does not own a majority of the equity interest or lack ofcontrol using the equity method.For equity investments which the Group does not have significant influence, the cost method accounting is applied.The Group assesses its equity investments for other-than-temporary impairment by considering factors as well as all relevant and availableinformation including, but not limited to, current economic and market conditions, the operating performance of the companies including current earningstrends and other company-specific information such as financing rounds.No impairment charges were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012and 2013.l.Property, equipment and software, net              Property, equipment and software are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.Property, equipment and software are depreciatedat rates sufficient to write off their costsF-20Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)2.Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)less impairment and residual value, if any, over the estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.The estimated useful lives are as follows:              Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expenses as incurred, whereas the cost of renewals and betterment that extends the useful lives ofproperty, equipment and software are capitalized as additions to the related assets.Retirements, sales and disposals of assets are recorded by removing thecosts, accumulated depreciation and impairment with any resulting gain or loss recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations andComprehensive Loss.m.Construction in progress              Direct costs that are related to the construction of property, equipment and software and incurred in connection with bringing the assets to theirintended use are capitalized as construction in progress.Construction in progress is transferred to specific property, equipment and software items and thedepreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.As of December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, the balance ofconstruction in progress were RMB Nil, RMB361,913 and RMB1,237,644, which was primarily related to the construction of office buildingsand warehouses.n.Intangible assets, netDomain name and copyrights              Domain name and copyrights purchased from third parties are initially recorded at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimatedeconomic useful lives of approximately ten years and two to five years, respectively.Intangible assets arising from business combination              The Group performs valuation of the intangible assets arising from business combination to determine the relative fair value to be assigned to eachasset acquired.The acquired intangible assets are recognized and measured at fair value and are expensed or amortized using the straight-line approach overthe estimated economic useful life of the assets as follows:F-21Category Estimated useful livesElectronic equipment 3 yearsOffice equipment 5

per share data)2.Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)o.Land use rights, net              Land use rights are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization.Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful liveswhich are generally 50 years and represent the shorter of the estimated usage periods or the terms of the agreements.p.Goodwill              Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination.Goodwill is not depreciated or amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of December 31, and in between annual tests when anevent occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired.In accordance with the FASB guidance on \"Testing of Goodwillfor Impairment,\" a company first has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reportingunit is less than its carrying amount.If the company decides, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of areporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is mandatory.Otherwise, no further testing is required.The quantitativeimpairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.If the carrying amount of eachreporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss equal to the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and thecarrying amount of goodwill will be recorded.Application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including theidentification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value ofeach reporting unit.The judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount ratesand making other assumptions.Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.No impairment loss was recognized for any of the periods presented.q.Impairment of long-lived assets              Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to marketconditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable or that the useful life is shorterthan the Group had originally estimated.When these events occur, the Group evaluates the impairment for the long-lived assets by comparing the carryingvalue of the assets to an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition.If thesum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the assets, the Group recognizes an impairment loss based on the excessof the carrying value of the assets over the fair value of the assets.No impairment charge was recognized for any of the periods presented.r.Fair value              Accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transactionbetween market participants at the measurement date.When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted toF-22Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)2.Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)be recorded at fair value, the Group considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that marketparticipants would use when pricing the asset or liability.Accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use ofunobservable inputs when measuring fair value.A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of inputthat is significant to the fair value measurement.Accounting guidance establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:Level 1—Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2—Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.Level 3—Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.Accounting guidance also describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: (1) market approach; (2) incomeapproach and (3) cost approach.The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated from market transactions involving identical orcomparable assets or liabilities.The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount.Themeasurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts.The cost approach is based on the amount thatwould currently be required to replace an asset.Financial assets and liabilities of the Group primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, accountsreceivable, prepayments and other current asset, accounts payable, short-term bank loan, taxes payable, advance from customers and accrued expenses andother current liabilities.As of December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, the carrying values of these financial instruments approximated to their fair values due tothe short-term maturity of these instruments.s.Revenue              The Group engages primarily in the sale of electronics and home appliance products and general merchandise products (including audio, videoproducts and books) sourced from manufacturers, distributors and publishers in China on the internet through its website jd.com.The Group also offers anonline marketplace that enables third-party sellers to sell their products to customers on jd.com.Customers place their orders for products online through thewebsite jd.com.Payment for the purchased products is generally made either before delivery or upon delivery.Consistent with the criteria of ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, the Group recognizes revenues when the following four revenue recognition criteriaare met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the selling price is fixed ordeterminable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.In accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, the Group evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales andrelated costs or the net amount earned as commissions.When the Group is primarily obligated in a transaction, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude inestablishing prices and selecting suppliers, or has several but not necessary all of theseF-23Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)2.Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)indicators, revenues should be recorded on a gross basis.When the Group is not the primary obligor, doesn't bear the inventory risk and doesn't have theability to establish the price, revenues are recorded on a net basis.Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting and arrangement consideration is allocated usingestimated selling prices if we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of the selling prices of the deliverables.The Group recognizes revenue net of discounts and return allowances when the products are delivered and title passes to customers.Returnallowances, which reduce net revenues, are estimated based on historical experiences.The Group also sells prepaid cards which can be redeemed to purchase products sold by the Group.The cash collected from the sales of prepaid cardsis initially recorded in advance from customers in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently recognized as revenues for the sales of the respectiveproduct when the prepaid cards are redeemed.Revenue is recorded net of value-added taxes, business taxes and related surcharges.Online Direct Sales              The Group primarily sells electronics and home appliance products and general merchandise products through online direct sales.The Grouprecognizes the revenues from the online direct sales on a gross basis as the Group is primarily obligated in these transactions, is subject to inventory risk, haslatitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or has met several but not necessary all of these indicators.Revenues from the sales of electronics andhome appliance products were RMB18,387,816, RMB34,011,756 and RMB56,814,078, and revenues from the sales of general merchandise products wereRMB2,500,195, RMB6,322,795 and RMB10,203,899, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.Services and Others              The revenues of services and others primarily consist of fees charged to third-party sellers for participating in the Group's online marketplace, wherethe Group generally is not the primary obligor, does not bear the inventory risk, does not have the ability to establish the price and control the relatedshipping services when utilized by the online marketplace merchants.Upon successful sales at jd.com, the Group will charge the third-party sellers anegotiated amount or a fixed rate commission fee based on the sales amount.Commission fee revenues are recognized on a net basis at the point of deliveryof products, net of return allowance.The Group also provides advertising placements for a specified period of time on its various website channels and in various formats, including butnot limited to banners, links, logos, buttons, and content integration.The Group recognizes revenues ratably over the period during which the advertisingservices were provided.Advertising arrangements involving multiple deliverables are allocated into single-element arrangements based on their relativeselling price in the absence of both vendor specific objective evidence and third party evidence, and the related revenue is recognized over the period duringwhich the element is provided.Significant assumptions and estimates have been made in estimating the relative selling price of each single-element, andchanges in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing of advertising revenue recognition.TheF-24Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)2.Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)Group did not enter into material advertising-for-advertising barter transactions, or any other types of barter transactions.The Group earns transaction fees from processing transactions for online payment customers.Revenues resulting from these transactions arerecognized when transactions are completed.Transaction fee is charged based on certain criteria (such as account type and volume of payments received permonth) for funds they receive.The Group offers comprehensive customer services, primarily include 7*24 hours customer service to respond to customer post-sales requests, returnand exchange service to facilitate customer's return, exchange and repair of defective goods.These services are free of charge.The Group also providesreturn/exchange logistic service to the customers, of which the revenues recognized was not material for the periods presented.t.Customer incentives and loyalty programs              The Group provides two types of discounted coupons, referred to as D Coupons and J Coupons, for free to its customers to incentivize purchase.•D Coupons are given to a customer upon their current purchase or can be given for free to promote future purchases.This coupon requires thecustomer to make future purchase of a minimum value in order to enjoy the value provided by the coupon.The right to purchase discountedproducts in the future is not considered an element of an arrangement within the scope of the multiple-element arrangements guidance in ASC605, as the right does not represent a significant and incremental discount to the customer.The Group assesses the significance of the discountby considering its percentage of the total future minimum purchase value, historical usage pattern by the customers and relative outstandingvolume and monetary value of D Coupons compared to the other discounts offered by the Group.D Coupons are accounted for as a reductionof revenue on the future purchase.•J Coupons are given to a customer that has made a qualified purchase and is to be used on a future purchase, with no limitation as to theminimum value of the future purchase.Accordingly, the Group has determined that J Coupons awarded during a purchase activity areconsidered an element of an arrangement within the scope of ASC 605-25, as the J Coupons represent a significant and incremental discount tothe customer.Therefore, the delivered products and the J Coupons awarded are treated as separate unit of accounting.The selling price of theJ Coupons awarded is generally determined by management's best estimate of the selling price in the absence of both vendor specific objectiveevidence and third party evidence.The amount allocated to the J Coupons is deferred and recognized when the J Coupons are redeemed or atthe coupon's expiration, whichever occurs first.J Coupons have an expiration of one year after issuance.For the years ended December 31,2011, 2012 and 2013, the amount of expired J Coupons was not material.Registered customers may also earn loyalty points based on certain activities performed on the Group's website such as purchasing merchandise orreviewing their buying experiences.Customers may redeem the loyalty points for J Coupons used for future purchase of selected items without minimumpurchase requirements.The Group considers loyalty points awarded from sales of products and reviewing buying experiences to be part of its revenuegenerating activities, and such arrangements areF-25Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)2.Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)considered to have multiple elements.Therefore, the sales consideration is allocated to the products and loyalty points based on the relative selling price ofthe products and loyalty points awarded.Consideration allocated to the loyalty points is initially recorded as deferred revenues, and recognized as revenueswhen the J Coupons for which the loyalty points are redeemed are used.As of December 31, 2013, loyalty points have no expiration date.u.Cost of revenues              Cost of revenues consists of the purchase price of products and inbound shipping charges, as well as write-downs of inventory.Shipping charges toreceive products from the suppliers are included in the inventories, and recognized as cost of revenues upon sale of the products to the customers.Paymentprocessing and related transaction costs, including those associated with the sales transactions as well as packaging material costs, are classified in fulfillmentin the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.v.Rebates and subsidies              The Group periodically receives consideration from certain vendors, representing rebates for products sold and subsidies for the sales of the vendors'products over a period of time.The rebates are not sufficiently separable from the Group's purchase of the vendors' products and they do not represent areimbursement of costs incurred by the Group to sell vendors' products.The Group accounts for the rebates received from its vendors as a reduction to theprice it pays for the products purchased and therefore the Group records such amounts as a reduction of cost of revenues when recognized in the ConsolidatedStatements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.Rebates are earned based on reaching minimum purchase thresholds for a specified period.When volumerebates can be reasonably estimated based on the Group's past experiences and current forecasts, a portion of the rebate is recognized as the Group makesprogress towards the purchase threshold.Subsidies are calculated based on the volume of products sold through the Group and are recorded as a reduction ofcost of revenues when the sales have been completed and the amount is determinable.w.Fulfillment              Fulfillment costs represent packaging material costs and those costs incurred in outbound shipping, operating and staffing the Group's fulfillment andcustomer service centers, including costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging and preparingcustomer orders for shipment; processing payment and related transaction costs and responding to inquiries from customers.Fulfillment costs also containthird party transaction fees, such as credit card processing and debit card processing fees.Shipping cost amounted to RMB832,164, RMB1,615,912 andRMB2,068,781 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.x.Marketing

shares, restricted share units (\"RSUs\") and share options to eligible employees,non-employee consultants and the Founder of the Company and accounts for these share-based awards in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation—StockCompensation and ASC 505-50 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.Employees' share-based awards are measured at the grant date fair value of the awards and recognized as expenses a) immediately at grant date if novesting conditions are required; or b) using graded vesting method, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period.All transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of theconsideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.Non-employees' share-based awards are measured at fair value at the earlier of the commitment date or the date the services are completed.Awardsgranted to non-employees are re-measured at each reporting date using the fair value at each period end until the measurement date, generally when theservices are completed and awards are vested.Changes in fair value between the reporting dates are recognized by graded vesting method.Founder share-based awards are measured at the grant date fair value of the awards and recognized as expenses based on the probable outcome of theperformance conditions.If a share-based award is modified after the grant date, we evaluate for such modifications in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation—StockCompensation and the modification is determined to be a probable-to-probable (Type 1) modification, additional compensation expenses are recognized inan amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified equity instrument over the fair value of the original equity instrument immediately beforemodification.The additional compensation expenses are recognized immediately on the date of modification or over the remaining requisite service period,depending on the vesting status of the award.F-27Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)2.Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)              The fair value of the restricted ordinary shares, non-vested ordinary shares and RSUs were assessed using the income approach/discounted cash flowmethod, with a discount for lack of marketability given that the shares underlying the awards were not publicly traded at the time of grant.This assessmentrequired complex and subjective judgments regarding the Company's projected financial and operating results, its unique business risks, the liquidity of itsordinary shares and its operating history and prospects at the time the grants were made.In addition, the binomial option-pricing model is used to measurethe value of share options.The determination of the fair value is affected by the fair value of the ordinary shares as well as assumptions regarding a number ofcomplex and subjective variables, including the expected share price volatility, actual and projected employee and non-employee share option exercisebehavior, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends.The fair value of these awards was determined with the assistance from an independent valuationfirm using management's estimates and assumptions.The assumptions used in share-based compensation expense recognition represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherentuncertainties and application of management judgment.If factors change or different assumptions are used, the share-based compensation expenses could bematerially different for any period.Moreover, the estimates of fair value of the awards are not intended to predict actual future events or the value thatultimately will be realized by grantees who receive share-based awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the originalestimates of fair value made by the Company for accounting purposes.Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised in the subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.bb.Income tax              Current income taxes are provided on the basis of net income for financial reporting purposes, adjusted for income and expense items which are notassessable or deductible for income tax purposes, in accordance with the regulations of the relevant tax jurisdictions.The Group follows the liability methodof accounting for income taxes.Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financialstatements carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities by applying enacted statutory tax rates that will be in effect in the period in whichthe temporary differences are expected to reverse.The Group records a valuation allowance to reduce the amount of deferred tax assets if based on the weightof available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.The effect on deferred taxes of achange in tax rates is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in the period of change.The Group recognizes in its consolidated financial statements the benefit of a tax position if the tax position is \"more likely than not\" to prevail basedon the facts and technical merits of the position.Tax positions that meet the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold are measured at the largest amountof tax benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement.The Group estimates its liability for unrecognized tax benefitswhich are periodically assessed and may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, changes and/or developments withrespect to tax audits, and expiration of the statute of limitations.The ultimate outcome for a particular tax position may not be determined with certaintyprior to the conclusion of a tax audit and, in some cases, appeal or litigation process.The actual benefits ultimatelyF-28Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)2.Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)realized may differ from the Group's estimates.As each audit is concluded, adjustments, if any, are recorded in the Group's consolidated financial statementsin the period in which the audit is concluded.Additionally, in future periods, changes in facts, circumstances and new information may require the Group toadjust the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions.Changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recognizedin the period in which the changes occur.As of December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, the Group did not have any significant unrecognized uncertaintax positions.cc.Leases              Each lease is classified at the inception date as either a capital lease or an operating lease.For the lessee, a lease is a capital lease if any of thefollowing conditions exist: a) ownership is transferred to the lessee by the end of the lease term, b) there is a bargain purchase option, c) the lease term is atleast 75% of the property's estimated remaining economic life or d) the present value of the minimum lease payments at the beginning of the lease term is90% or more of the fair value of the leased property to the leaser at the inception date.A capital lease is accounted for as if there was an acquisition of an assetand an incurrence of an obligation at the inception of the lease.All other leases are accounted for as operating leases.Payments made under operating leaseare charged to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss on a straight-line basis over the terms of underlying lease.The Group hasno capital leases for any of the periods presented.dd.Comprehensive income/(loss)              Comprehensive income/(loss) is defined to include all changes in equity of the Group during a period arising from transactions and other event andcircumstances except those resulting from investments by shareholders and distributions to shareholders.For the periods presented, the Group'scomprehensive income/(loss) includes net income/(loss) and foreign currency translation adjustments and is presented in the Consolidated Statements ofOperations and Comprehensive Loss.ee.Earnings (Loss) per share              Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to holders of ordinary shares, considering the accretions toredemption value of the preferred shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period using the two-class method.Under the two-class method, net income is allocated between ordinary shares and other participating securities based on their participating rights.Dilutedearnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders, as adjusted for the accretion and allocation of netincome related to the preferred shares, if any, by the weighted average number of ordinary and dilutive ordinary equivalent shares outstanding during theperiod.Ordinary equivalent shares consist of shares issuable upon the conversion of the preferred shares using the if-converted method, unvested restrictedshares, restricted share units and ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding share option (using the treasury stock method).Ordinaryequivalent shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive.F-29Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)2.Summary of significant

videoproducts and books) sourced from manufacturers, distributors and publishers in PRC on the internet through its website jd.com.The Group also operates itsonline marketplace under which third-party sellers sell products on the Group's website to customers.The Group does not distinguish revenues, costs andexpenses between segments in its internal reporting, and reports costs and expenses by nature as a whole.The Group's chief operating decision maker, whohas been identified as the Chief Executive Officer, reviews the consolidated results when making decisions about allocating resources and assessingperformance of the Group as a whole and hence, the Group has only one reportable segment.The Group operates and manages its business as a single segmentmainly through the provision of a single class of services for accelerating and improving the delivery of its products over the internet.The Group does notdistinguish between markets or segments for the purpose of internal reports.As the Group's long-lived assets are all located in the PRC and most of all theGroup's revenues are derived from the PRC, no geographical segments are presented.gg.Statutory reserves              The Group's subsidiaries, VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries established in the PRC are required to make appropriations to certain non-distributablereserve funds.In accordance with the laws applicable to the Foreign Investment Enterprises established in the PRC, the Group's subsidiaries registered as wholly-owned foreign enterprise have to make appropriations from their after-tax profits (as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the PRC(\"PRC GAAP\")) to reserve funds including general reserve fund, enterprise expansion fund and staff bonus and welfare fund.The appropriation to the generalreserve fund must be at least 10% of the after-tax profits calculated in accordance with PRC GAAP.Appropriation is not required if the general reserve fundhas reached 50% of the registered capital of the company.Appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff bonus and welfare fund are made at therespective company's discretion.In addition, in accordance with the PRC Company Laws, the Group's VIE and VIEs subsidiaries, registered as Chinese domestic companies, mustmake appropriations from their after-tax profits as determined under the PRC GAAP to non-distributable reserve funds including statutory surplus fund anddiscretionary surplus fund.The appropriation to the statutory surplus fund must be 10% of the after-tax profits as determined under PRC GAAP.Appropriation is not required if the statutory surplus fund has reached 50% of the registered capital of the company.Appropriation to the discretionarysurplus fund is made at the discretion of the respective company.The use of the general reserve fund, enterprise expansion fund, statutory surplus fund and discretionary surplus fund are restricted to the offsetting oflosses or increasing of the registered capital of the respective company.The staff bonus and welfare fund is a liability in nature and is restricted to fundpayments of special bonus to employees and for the collective welfare of employees.None of these reserves are allowed to be transferred to the company interms of cash dividends, loans or advances, nor can they be distributed except under liquidation.F-30Table of

          For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, profit appropriation to statutory surplus fund for the Group's entities incorporated in the PRCwas approximately RMB Nil, RMB1,838 and RMB810, respectively.No appropriation to other reserve funds was made for any of the periods presented.hh.Recent accounting pronouncements              In July 2012, the FASB issued revised guidance on \"Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.\"The revised guidance provides anentity the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not thatan indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, an entity concludes that it is not more likely thannot that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action.However, if an entity concludes otherwise, thenit is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform a quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value withthe carrying amount in accordance with U.S. GAAP.The revised guidance is effective for the Company for annual and interim impairment tests performed forthe fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2013.This amendment will not have a material effect on the Group's financial position, results of operationsor liquidity.In February 2013, the FASB issued revised guidance on \"Comprehensive Income: Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated OtherComprehensive Income.\"The revised guidance does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income infinancial statements.However, the revised guidance requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated othercomprehensive income by component.In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in thenotes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amountreclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period.For other amounts that are not requiredunder U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP thatprovide additional detail about those amounts.The revised guidance is effective prospectively for the Company for the reporting periods beginning onJanuary 1, 2013.The revised guidance will not have a material effect on the Group's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, \"Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar TaxLoss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists\", which is an update to provide guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefitwhen a net operating loss carryforward exists.The guidance requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as areduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, except for when a net operating loss carryforward is not available as of the reportingdate to settle taxes that would result from the disallowance of the tax position or when the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for purposes ofreducing the net operating loss carry forward.The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013 and for interim periods within thatfiscal year.The Group does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.F-31Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)3.Concentration and risksConcentration of customers and suppliers              There are no customers or suppliers from whom revenues or purchases individually represent greater than 10% of the total revenues or the totalpurchases of the Group for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013.Concentration of credit risk              Assets that potentially subject the Group to significant concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash,accounts receivable and short-term investments.The maximum exposure of such assets to credit risk is their carrying amounts as of the balance sheet dates.As of December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, all of the Group's cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments were held by majorfinancial institutions located in the PRC and Hong Kong which management believes are of high credit quality.PRC does not have an official depositinsurance program, nor does it have an agency similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in the United States.However, the Group believesthat the risk of failure of any of these PRC banks is remote.Bank failure is uncommon in China and the Group believes that those Chinese banks that hold theGroup's cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments are financially sound based on public available information.Accountsreceivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers in the PRC.The risk with respect to accounts receivable is mitigatedby credit evaluations the Group performs on its customers and its ongoing monitoring process of outstanding balances.Currency convertibility risk              The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies.The Group's cash and cash equivalents, restricted cashand short-term investments denominated in RMB that are subject to such government controls amounted to RMB1,538,305, RMB6,359,129 andRMB9,865,714 as of December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.The value of RMB is subject to changes in the central government policies and tointernational economic and political developments affecting supply and demand in the PRC foreign exchange trading system market.In the PRC, certainforeign exchange transactions are required by law to be transacted only by authorized financial institutions at exchange rates set by the People's Bank ofChina (the \"PBOC\").Remittances in currencies other than RMB by the Group in the PRC must be processed through PBOC or other Chinese foreignexchange regulatory bodies which require certain supporting documentation in order to process the remittance.Foreign currency exchange rate risk              From July 21, 2005, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies.While theinternational reaction to the RMB appreciation has generally been positive, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adoptan even more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar.F-32Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and

issuance of bankacceptance and letter of guarantee, the Group held restricted cash of RMB289,971, RMB920,130 and RMB342,387 as of December 31, 2011, 2012 and2013, respectively.Changes in the restricted cash balance associated with the bank acceptance are classified as cash flows from operating activities as theGroup considers restricted cash arising from these activities directly related to the Group's ordinary business operations.To maintain guarantee balances at the bank as collaterals for the short-term bank loans of US$138,000 and US$153,000 (see Note 14), the Group heldrestricted cash of RMB1,000,000 and RMB1,000,000 as of December 31, 2012 and 2013, which were bank deposits with the original term of one year at thebank, respectively.In addition, the Group held restricted cash of RMB545,000 for capital verification of establishment of new entities as of December 31,2013.Changes in the restricted cash balance associated with short-term bank loans and capital verification are classified as cash flow from investingactivities as the Group considers restricted cash arising from these activities similar to an investment.5.Fair value measurement              As of December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, information about inputs into the fair value measurements of the Group's assets that are measured at fairvalue on a recurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial

measurement (Continued)              When available, the Group uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value of an asset or liability.If quoted market prices are not available, theGroup will measure fair value using valuation techniques that use, when possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such asinterest rates and currency rates.Following is a description of the valuation techniques that the Group uses to measure the fair value of assets that the Groupreports on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a recurring basis.Cash equivalents              Money market fund.The Group values its money market fund using observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for securities with identicalcharacteristics, and accordingly, the Group classifies the valuation techniques that use these inputs as Level 1.Time deposits.The Group values its time deposits held in certain bank accounts using quoted prices for securities with similar characteristics andother observable inputs, and accordingly, the Group classifies the valuation techniques that use these inputs as Level 2.Restricted cash              Restricted cash is valued based on the pervasive interest rate in the market, and accordingly, the Group classifies the valuation techniques that usethese inputs as Level 2.Available for sale securities              Available-for-sale securities are valued using alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs, and accordingly the Groupclassifies the valuation techniques that use these inputs as Level 2.Other financial instruments              The followings are other financial instruments not measured at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets, but for which the fair value is estimatedfor disclosure purposes.F-34    Fair value measurement at reporting date using Description December 31,2013 Quoted Pricesin Active Marketsfor Identical Assets(Level 1) Significant

and payables.Accounts receivable and prepayments and other assets are financial assets with carrying values that approximatefair value due to their short term nature.Accounts payable, advance from customers, accrued expenses and other liabilities and deferred revenues are financialliabilities with carrying values that approximate fair value due to their short term nature.Short-term bank loan.The rates of interest under the loan agreements with the lending banks were determined based on the prevailing interest rates inthe market.The Group classifies the valuation techniques that use these inputs as Level 2 of fair value measurements of short-term bank loan.Prepayments and other assets in non-current assets.Prepayments and other assets in non-current assets are financial assets with carrying values thatapproximates fair value due to the change in fair value after considering the discount rate.The Group estimated fair values of non-current prepayments andother assets using the discount cash flow method.The Group classifies the valuation technique as Level 3 of fair value measurement, as it uses estimated cashflow input which is unobservable in the market.6.Business Combination              On October 31, 2012, the Group invested RMB145,500 through Jingdong 360 to acquire 100% of the equity interests in Chinabank Payment and itswholly owned subsidiary Chinabank Payment Technology.The main purpose of the acquisition is to offer flexible payment service to the Group's onlineshopping customers and to improve cost efficiency in the Group's payment processing.The acquisition had been accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations of Chinabank Payment from the acquisition date havebeen included in the Group's consolidated financial statements.The Group made estimates and judgments in determining the fair value of acquired assets andliabilities, based on management's experiences with similar assets and liabilities with the assistance from an independent valuation firm.The allocation of thepurchase price is as follows:F-35  RMB Weighted average amortizationperiod at the acquisition date(in years) Tangible assets acquired

Business Combination (Continued)              Goodwill primarily represents the expected synergies from combining operations of the Group, Chinabank Payment and Chinabank PaymentTechnology, which are complementary to each other, and any other intangible benefits that would accrue to the Group that do not qualify for separaterecognition.The excess of purchase price over net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired were recorded as goodwill.The goodwill is notexpected to be deductible for tax purposes.No measurement period adjustment has been recorded.Based on the assessment on the acquired companies' financial performance made by the Group, the acquired company including its subsidiary is notconsidered material to the Group.Thus the presentation of the pro-forma financial information with regard to a summary of the results of operations of theGroup for the business combination is not required.7.Accounts receivable, net              Accounts

to any Hong Kong withholding tax.China              On March 16, 2007, the National People's Congress of PRC enacted a new Corporate Income Tax Law (\"new CIT law\"), under which ForeignInvestment Enterprises (\"FIEs\") and domestic companies would be subject to corporate income tax at a uniform rate of 25%.The new CIT law becameeffective on January 1, 2008.Under the new CIT law, preferential tax treatments will continue to be granted to entities which conduct businesses in certainencouraged sectors and to entities otherwise classified as \"high and new technology enterprises\".Chinabank Payment Technology has been qualified as \"high and new technology enterprise\" since 2010, and enjoyed a preferential corporate incometax rate of 15% from 2011 to 2013.Chinabank Payment Technology will continue to benefit from the same income tax rate in 2014, provided that itcontinues to be qualified as \"high and new technology enterprise\" during such period.The Group's other PRC

established under the laws of a foreign country or region but whose \"de facto management body\" islocated in the PRC be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes and consequently be subject to the PRC income tax at the rate of 25% for itsglobal income.The Implementing Rules of the EIT Law merely define the location of the \"de facto management body\" as \"the place where the exercising, insubstance, of the overall management and control of the production and business operation, personnel, accounting, property, etc., of a non-PRC company islocated.\"Based on a review of

a withholding income tax of 10% on dividends distributed by an FIE to its immediate holding company outside ofChina, if such immediate holding company is considered as a non-resident enterprise without any establishment or place within China or if the receiveddividends have no connection with the establishment or place of such immediate holding company within China, unless such immediate holding company'sjurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement.The Cayman Islands, where the Companyincorporated, does not have such tax treaty with China.According to the arrangement between Mainland China and Hong Kong Special AdministrativeRegion on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion in August 2006, dividends paid by an FIE in China to its immediate holdingcompany in Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at a rate of no more than 5% (if the foreign investor owns directly at least 25% of the shares of theFIE).The Company did not record any dividend withholding tax, as it has no retained earnings for any of the periods presented.Reconciliations of the differences between PRC

classified the Series A, A-1, B and C Preferred Shares in the mezzanine equity ofthe Consolidated Balance Sheets.As a result of the waiver to the redemption and preferential liquidation rights in 2010 in association with the issuance ofSeries C Preferred Shares, the Series A, A-1 and B Preferred Shares were reclassified from mezzanine equity to permanent equity in the ConsolidatedBalance Sheets.The fair market value of the Preferred Shares was greater than their original purchase price as of December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013.The Companyaccretes changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance to the earliest redemption date of the Preferred Shares using effectiveinterest method.Changes in the redemption value are considered to be changes in accounting estimates.The Company ceased to record accretion chargesrelated to Series A, A-1 and B Preferred Shares upon the waiver of their redemption rights.Upon closing of the initial public offering, the Preferred Shares willconvert into ordinary shares and the Series C Preferred Shares redemption value accretion will cease.The accretion is recorded against retained earnings, or inthe absence of retained earnings, by charges against additional paid-in-capital.Once additional paid-in-capital has been exhausted, additional charges arerecorded by increasing the accumulated deficit.F-47Table of ContentsJD.com,

ratio, subject to adjustments for dilution, including but not limited to stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalization.Each Preferred Shares isconvertible into a number of ordinary shares determined by dividing the applicable original issuance price by the conversion price.The conversion price ofeach Preferred Shares is the same as its original issuance price if no adjustments to conversion price have occurred.As of December 31, 2013, each PreferredShares is convertible into one ordinary share.Prior to the issuance of Series B Preferred Shares, each Series A and A-1 Preferred

Preferred Shares were exchanged for and re-designated into Series C Preferred Shares orordinary shares.The table below summarizes these transactions:F-49Exchange/re-designation

the Group extinguished 64,579,075 Series A-1 Preferred Shares and 15,498,980 Series B PreferredShares in exchange for a total of 80,078,055 Series C Preferred Shares.The transaction represents a repurchase of the Series A-1 and B Preferred Shares andissuance of the Series C Preferred Shares to the new investors and is accounted for under extinguishment accounting.The excess of the fair value of theconsideration transferred in the amount of RMB415,381 to the holders of the Series A-1 and B Preferred Shares over the carrying amount of the Series A-1and B Preferred Shares in the amount of RMB123,596, net of foreign exchange impact, would be recognized as deemed dividends.However, since the Groupdid not have any retained earnings, the excess was charged to additional paid-in capital which equaled to RMB304,054 with total translation adjustmentgain amounted to RMB12,269.The fair value of the Series C Preferred Shares was assessed using the income approach/discounted cash flow method, with a discount for lack ofmarketability given that the shares underlying the award were not publicly traded at the time of grant, and was determined with the assistance from anindependent valuation firm using management's estimates and assumptions.•Re-designated into Ordinary Shares                135,024,615 Series B Preferred Shares, 29,466,925 Series A-1 Preferred Shares and 25,247,161 Series B Preferred Shares were transferred to newinvestors and re-designated into ordinary shares in May 2010, August 2011 and December 2013, respectively.These transactions would be viewed as if theholders of the Series B and A-1 Preferred Shares exercised their option to convert Series B and A-1 Preferred Shares into ordinary shares, and thensubsequently transferred the newly converted ordinary shares to the new investors.Accordingly, the carrying amounts of the Series B and A-1 PreferredShares were reduced, offset by increases in the ordinary shares and additional paid-in capital which equaled to RMB148,490, RMB38,545 and RMB34,108,respectively, with total translation adjustment gains amounted to RMB187, RMB7,255 and RMB4,065, respectively.20.Warrants              In conjunction of the issuance of the Series C Preferred Shares, the Group granted warrants (\"Warrants-C\") to two of the Series C Preferred Sharesinvestors to acquire 78,786,475 and 5,166,325 shares of ordinary shares, respectively.The warrants have an exercise price of US$0.7742 per ordinary share,and exercisable at any time during a period commencing on the issuance of the warrants and expiring on the earlier of (i) a Second Qualified IPO (as definedin Note 18); or (ii) 20 months from the date of issuance of the warrants.Warrants-C were classified in permanent equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets because they were exercisable to purchase ordinary shares, andthe Group had sufficient authorized and unissued ordinary shares to settle the warrant contract.In addition, there were no other terms that would require cashsettlement.Warrants-C were initially measured at fair value, and the cash proceeds of the Series C Preferred Shares were allocated on a relative fair value basisto the Series C Preferred Shares issued and Warrants-C.F-50Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)20.Warrants (Continued)              The relative fair value of the Warrants-C at issuance was RMB15,327, which was estimated on the basis of Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model withthe following assumptions:              The volatility of the Group's ordinary shares was estimated by management based on the historical volatility of similar U.S. and Hong Kong publiccompanies.The risk-free interest rate was implied yield rate of China government bonds denominated in US$ for a term applicable to the expected life of thewarrants.The dividend yield was estimated based on the Group's expected dividend policy over the expected life of the warrants.The expected life reflectsthe best estimated period during which the warrants would be exercised.In February 2012, upon the exercise of the Warrants-C, the Company issued 83,952,800 ordinary shares for considerations amountedto RMB410,164.21.Ordinary Shares              Upon inception, each ordinary share was issued at a par value of US$0.00002 per share.In March 2007, the Company issued 319,000,000 ordinaryshares at a par value of US$0.00002 and became the holding company of the Group pursuant to the reorganization events described in Note 1.Subsequently,various numbers of ordinary shares were issued to share-based compensation award recipients and investors.As of December 31, 2013, the authorized sharecapital of the Company is US$60 divided into 2,435,536,365 ordinary shares, 221,360,925 Series A and A-1 Preferred Shares, 84,786,405 Series B PreferredShares and 258,316,305 Series C Preferred Shares at a par value

program (the \"Program\") pursuant to which eligible employeeswere able to exchange certain unvested RSUs for share options with the exercise price of US$3.96.The Program expired on December 27, 2013.As a result ofthe Program, 155 employees exchanged 7,954,526 unvested RSU for options to purchase 23,863,578 ordinary shares at exercise price of US$3.96 per share.The new awards are subject to the original vesting schedule with the corresponding exchanged RSUs.The Company determined the modification is aprobable-to-probable modification (TYPE 1 modification), as the Program does not change the expectation that these award will ultimately vest.Theincremental value of RMB89,030 as the result of the exchange will be recognized as expenses over the remaining vesting periods of 1 to 6 years.1) Employee awards              The non-vested ordinary shares, RSUs and share options are scheduled to be vested over three to six years:              (1).One-third, one-fourth, one fifth or

computed using the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.Diluted net lossper share is computed using the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding during the period.As a result of the modification of the Series A, A-1 and B Preferred Shares on September 21, 2010 (refer to Note 18), the Series A, A-1 and B PreferredShares were classified as separate classes of permanent equity securities with no senior or prior rights to ordinary shares, except for those dividend rightsdiscussed in Note 18.Accordingly for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, the \"two-class\" method is required to be used for the calculationof net loss per share.Since the Company did not declare any dividends for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, the net loss per shareattributable to each class would be the same under the \"two-class\" method for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013.As such, the three classesof shares have been presented on a combined basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss and in the above computation ofnet loss per share.Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of ordinary shares, Series A, A-1 and B Preferred Shares and dilutivepotential ordinary shares outstanding during the respective year.The potentially dilutive securities that were not included in the calculation of diluted netloss per share in the periods presented where their inclusion would be anti-dilutive include non-vested ordinary shares, RSUs and options to purchaseordinary shares of 21,008,288, 27,484,412 and 33,084,709, and Warrants-C of 83,952,800, 8,303,024 and Nil for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012and

and regulations permit payments of dividends by the Group's subsidiaries, VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries incorporated in PRC only out of theirretained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations.The results of operations reflected in the financialstatements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP differ from those reflected in the statutory financial

PRC is required to provide certain statutory reserve funds, namely general reserve fund, the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare andbonus fund which are appropriated from net profits as reported in the enterprise's PRC statutory financial statements.A foreign invested enterprise is requiredto allocate at least 10% of its annual after-tax profits to the general reserve fund until such reserve fund has reached 50% of its registered capital based on theenterprise's PRC statutory financial statements.Appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of theboard of directors for all foreign invested enterprises.The aforementioned reserved funds can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable ascash dividends.Additionally, in accordance with the Company Law of the PRC, a domestic enterprise is required to provide statutory surplus fund at least 10% of itsannual after-tax profits until such statutory surplus fund has reached 50% of its registered capital based on the enterprise's PRC statutory financial statements.A domestic enterprise is also required to provide discretionary surplus fund, at the discretion of the board of directors, from the net profits reported in theenterprise's PRC statutory financial statements.The aforementioned reserve funds can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable ascash dividends.As a result of these PRC laws and regulations that require annual appropriations of 10% of net after-tax profits to be set aside prior to payment ofdividends as general reserve fund or statutory surplus fund, the Group's PRC subsidiaries, VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer aportion of their net assets to the

the rewards normallyassociated with ownership of the entity, and therefore the Company or its subsidiary is the primary beneficiary of the entity.All transactions and balances among the Company, its subsidiaries, the VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation.c.Use of estimates              The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions thataffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related disclosures of contingent liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the reported revenues andexpenses during the reported period in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.Significant accounting estimates are used for, but notlimited to, sales returns, vendor and customer incentives, the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation arrangements, realization of deferred taxassets, fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combination, assessment for impairment of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill,allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation for excess and obsolete inventories, lower of cost and market value of inventories, depreciable lives ofproperty, equipment and software, useful life of intangible assets and redemption value of the redeemable preferred shares.Actual results may differmaterially from those estimates.d.Foreign currency translation              The Group's reporting currency is Renminbi (\"RMB\").The functional currency of the Group's entities incorporated in Cayman Islands, British VirginIslands (\"BVI\") and Hong Kong (\"HK\") is the United States dollars (\"US$\").The Group's PRC subsidiaries, VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries determined theirfunctional currency to be RMB.The determination of the respective functional currency is based on the criteria set out in ASC 830, Foreign CurrencyMatters.Transactions denominated in currencies other than functional currency are translated into functional currency at the exchange rates quoted byauthoritative banks prevailing at the dates of the transactions.Exchange gains and losses resulting from those foreign currency transactions denominated in acurrency other than the functional currency are recorded as a component of Others, net in the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Statements

ofaccounting to account for an equity investment, in common stock or in-substance common stock, according to ASC 323 \"Investment—Equity Method andJoint Ventures\", over which it has significant influence but does not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control.An investment in in-substance common stock is an investment in an entity that has risk and reward characteristics that are substantially similar to thatentity's common stock.The Company considers subordination, risks and rewards of ownership and obligation to transfer value when determining whether aninvestment in an entity is substantially similar to an investment in that entity's common stock.For other equity investments that are not considered as debt securities or equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and over whichthe Company neither has significant influence nor control through investment in common stock or in-substance common stock, the cost method ofaccounting is used.The Company continually reviews its investments in equity investees to determine whether a decline in fair value to below the carrying value is otherthan temporary.The primary factors the Company considers in its determination are the length of time that the fair value of the investment is below theCompany's carrying value; the financial condition, operating performance and the prospects of the equity investee; and other company specific informationsuch as recent financing rounds.If the decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity investee is written down tofair value.No impairment charges were recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2014, respectively.g.Share-based compensation              The Company grants restricted ordinary shares, non-vested ordinary shares, restricted share units (\"RSUs\") and share options to eligible employees,non-employee consultants and the Founder of the Company and accounts for these share-based awards in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation—StockCompensation and ASC 505-50 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.F-77Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)2.Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)              Employees' share-based awards are measured at the grant date fair value of the awards and recognized as expenses a) immediately at grant date if novesting conditions are required; or b) using graded vesting method, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period.For performance-based awards, the performance goals and vesting schedule of these awards are determined by the Board of Directors at time of the grant andan evaluation is made each quarter as to the likelihood of the performance criteria being met.Share-based compensation expenses are then adjusted to reflectthe number of performance-based awards expected to vest to date.All transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of theconsideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.Non-employees' share-based awards are measured at fair value at the earlier of the commitment date or the date the services are completed.Awardsgranted to non-employees are re-measured at each reporting date using the fair value at each period end until the measurement date, generally when theservices are completed and awards are vested.Changes in fair value between the reporting dates are recognized by graded vesting method.h.RevenueOnline Direct Sales              Revenues from the sales of electronics and home appliance products were RMB40,370,555 and RMB64,021,723, and revenues from the sales ofgeneral merchandise products were RMB7,307,358

incurred, andtotaled RMB1,014,947 and RMB1,764,010 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2014, respectively.3.Concentration and risksCurrency convertibility risk              The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies.The Group's cash and cash equivalents, restricted cashand short-term investments denominated in RMB that are subject to such government controls amounted to RMB9,865,714 and RMB14,609,713 as ofDecember 31, 2013 and September 30, 2014, respectively.The value of RMB is subject to changes in the central government policies and to internationaleconomic and political developments affecting supply and demand in the PRC foreign exchange trading system market.In the PRC, certain foreign exchangetransactions are required by law to be transacted only by authorized financial institutions at exchange rates set by People's Bank of China (\"PBOC\").Remittances in currencies other than RMBF-78Table of

of bankacceptance and letter of guarantee, the Group held restricted cash of RMB342,387 and RMB1,514,340 as of December 31, 2013 and September 30, 2014respectively.Changes in the restricted cash balance associated with the bank acceptance are classified as cash flows from operating activities as the Groupconsiders restricted cash arising from these activities directly related to the Group's ordinary business operations.To maintain guarantee balances at the bank as collaterals for the short-term bank loans of US$153,000 and US$309,000 (see Note 14), the Group heldrestricted cash of RMB1,000,000 and RMB3,000,000 as of December 31, 2013 and September 30, 2014, respectively, which were bank deposits with theoriginal term of one year at the bank.In addition, the Group held restricted cash of RMB545,000 and RMB100,000 for capital verification of establishmentof new entities as of December 31, 2013 and September 30, 2014, respectively.Changes in the restricted cash balance associated with short-term bank loansand capital verification are classified as cash flow from investing activities as the Group considers restricted cash arising from these activities similar toan investment.5.Fair value measurement              As of the balance sheet dates presented, information about inputs into the fair value measurements of the Group's assets that are measured at fair

(\"Agreement\") with Tencent Holdings Limited (\"Tencent\"), for aperiod of 5 years from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2019.Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company will become Tencent's preferred partner in the developmentof physical goods e-Commerce business in Greater China including: (a) Tencent will grant the Company prominent level-1 access points in Weixin andmobile QQ applications; (b) Tencent will provide internet traffic and other support from other key platforms to the Company; and (c) the Company willcooperate with Tencent in a number of areas primarily mobile-related products, social networking services, membership systems and payment solutions.Terms described in (a), (b) and (c) above are hereinafter collectively referred to as \"Strategic Cooperation\".In addition, for a period of 8 years from April 1,2014 to March 31, 2022, other than the operation of Shanghai Icson E-Commerce Development Company Limited (\"Shanghai Icson\"), a subsidiary ofTencent.Tencent will not engage in any online direct sales or managed marketplace business model in physical goods e-Commerce businesses in GreaterChina and a few selected international markets, hereinafter referred to as \"Non-Compete\".On the same date, the Company also entered into a series of agreements with Tencent and its affiliates, pursuant to which, the Company acquired fromTencent: (i) 100% business operation of two online marketplace platforms, Paipai and QQ Wanggou (\"Combined Platform Business\"); (ii) 9.9% equityinterest in Shanghai Icson (\"Investment in Shanghai Icson\"); (iii) a call option (\"Call

of the Transaction; (iv) certainlogistic workforce; and (v) a land use right.The above (i) to (v), Strategic Cooperation and Non-Compete are collectively referred to as \"Transaction\".As consideration for the Transaction, the Company issued 351,678,637 ordinary shares to Huang River Investment Limited, a wholly-ownedsubsidiary of Tencent, representing 15% shares on a diluted basis

expand product and service offerings to the Group's online shopping customers.The acquisition of Combined Platform Business is accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations of the Combined PlatformBusiness from the acquisition date have been included in the Group's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements.The acquisitions ofStrategic Cooperation, Non-compete, Investment in Shanghai Icson, Logistic Workforce and Land use right are considered asset acquisitions separate fromthe acquisition of Combined Platform Business.The investment in Shanghai Icson was accounted for under the cost method and recorded in investment inequity investees on the acquisition day.The identifiable intangible assets acquired are amortized on a straight-line basis over the respective useful lives.The Company has performed the following steps to estimate the cost of the assets and business acquired with the assistance from an independentvaluation firm: 1) estimate the total fair value of 351,678,637 ordinary shares issued to Huang River Investment Limited as the consideration of thetransaction on March 10, 2014 using the income approach, or the discounted cash flow, or DCF, method; 2) estimate the stand-alone fair value of theCombined Platform Business as well as fair value of each of Strategic Cooperation Agreement, Non-Compete, Investment in Shanghai Icson, Logisticworkforce and Land Use Right (collectively \"Asset Acquisition\"); 3) The excess of (1) over sum of (2) and net cash acquired in the transaction has beenallocated to individual assets of the Asset Acquisition and the Combined Platform Business based on their relative fair values.Additionally, in accordancewith ASC 820, ASC 505-50, ASC 718 and SAB Topic 14.A, non-transferability relating to lock-up period associated with the shares issued to Huang RiverInvestment Limited for a period of three years commencing from March 10, 2014, is factored in estimating the fair value of shares issued to acquire StrategicCooperation, Non-compete, Investment in Shanghai Icson, Logistic Workforce and Land use right, but is not factored in estimating the fair value of sharesissued to acquire Combined Platform Business.The Company considered the following valuation method and significant assumptions in evaluating certain significant intangibles acquired from thecurrent Transaction:              Strategic Cooperation Agreement—In addition to the Company's general business cooperation with Tencent primarily in areas of mobile-relatedproducts, social networking services, membership systems and payment solutions, the other parts of the Strategic Cooperation Agreement is in substance aprepaid advertising/promotion service where Tencent users can be diverted to the Company's websites/platforms where (a) Tencent will grant the Companyprominent level-1 access points in Weixin and mobile QQ applications and (b) Tencent will provide internet traffic and other support from its other keyplatforms to the Company.These advertising/promotion services include push messages, advertising, payment processing, and application activation.Thegeneral business cooperation is not recognized as a separate intangible asset because such provisions only set out the general principal for the cooperationbetween the Company and Tencent with no specific deliverables provided to the Company.The amount recognized for the Strategic Cooperation Agreementrelates to the advertising/promotion services and the fair value was established using a form of the income approach known as the cost saving method.Thismethod recognizes that, because of the Strategic Cooperation Agreement, the Company can save advertising fees, traffic acquisition costs, paymentprocessing fees and application activation fees that otherwise it would need to be paid to a third party for the similarF-81Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)6.Acquisition of certain business, equity investment and intangible assets (Continued)services.The estimated unit market price of the advertising/promotion services were multiplied by the volume of the services to be provided by Tencent toarrive at the cost saving attributable to the Strategic Cooperation Agreement.The most significant assumptions inherent in this approach include: 1) theestimated market price of the services to be provided, 2) the volume of the services to be provided, and 3) discount rate.When applying the cost savingmethod for the valuation of the Strategic Cooperation Agreement, market participant assumptions were used in accordance with ASC 820.Specifically, thebasis of the assumptions were determined with consideration of the terms of the Strategic Cooperation Agreement, an industry report regarding China's e-commerce sector and a market rate that market participants have to pay to third parties for similar services on arm's length basis.The present value of the after-tax cost savings at an appropriate discount rate indicates the value of Strategic Cooperation Agreement.The discount rate was derived by using the capitalasset pricing model (the \"CAPM\"), which is a method that market participants commonly use to price assets.Based on the CAPM, the Company concluded adiscount rate of 17.5% was appropriate for valuing the Strategic Cooperation Agreement.Non-compete—Other than the operation of Shanghai Icson, Tencent will not engage in any online direct sales or managed marketplace businessmodels in physical goods e-Commerce business in Greater China and a few selected international markets.The fair value of the Non-compete was determinedbased on the \"with and without\" method, which takes into consideration the cash flow increments between the scenario where the Non-compete is not inplace and the scenario where the Non-compete is in place for a period of 8 years from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2022.The most significant assumptioninherent in this approach when valuing the Non-compete was the amount of economic impact to the Company that would occur from competition during theperiod when non-compete agreement is effective.Based on the CAPM, the Company concluded a discount rate of 17.5%, which reflects a market participant'srequired rate of return for the risks of investing in the Non-compete, was appropriate for discounting the cash flow attributable to the Non-compete.Investment in Shanghai Icson—In determining the fair value of the investment in Shanghai Icson, the Company followed a two-step process.In thefirst step, the discounted cash flow method, or DCF, was used as the primary approach to determine the fair value of the equity interest of Shanghai Icson andmarket approach to cross-check the valuation results derived by the DCF method.The free cashflow of Shanghai Icson was discounted by 22%, which wasdetermined by the CAPM to reflect a market participant's required rate of return for the risks of investing in the equity interest of Shanghai Icson.In thesecond step, since the Company's investment in Shanghai Icson is in the form of preferred shares, an option pricing method to allocate the equity interest ofShanghai Icson to its common shares and preferred shares was used.The significant assumptions inherent in option pricing models are the expected time ofliquidity event, risk free rate and volatility factor of equity interest of Shanghai Icson.The Group made estimates and judgments in determining the fair value of the acquired business, equity investment and intangible assets, based on anindependent valuation report andF-82Table of ContentsJD.com,

share.Since the Company was in a loss-making position and did not declare any dividends for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2014, the net lossper share attributable to each class would be the same under the \"two-class\" method in those periods.As such, the three classes of shares have been presentedon a combined basis in the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss and in the above computation ofnet loss per share.Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of ordinary shares, Series A, A-1 and B

degree of judgment orcomplexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the combined financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which theestimates are revised and in any future periods affected.None of the changes in estimates has a material effect on the Combined Platform Business' combined financial statements as at and for the yearsended 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013.2.4         Foreign currency translation(a)Functional and presentation currencyItems included in the combined financial statements of the Combined Platform Business are measured using the currency of the primaryeconomic environment in which the Combined Platform Business operates (\"functional currency\").The combined financial statements arepresented in RMB, which is the Combined Platform Business' functional and presentation currency.(b)Transactions and balancesForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates ofmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the combined statements of comprehensive loss.2.5         Property, plant and equipment              Property, plant and equipment comprise mainly of servers and electronic and other equipment.Property, plant and equipment are stated at historicalcost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment charge.Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition ofthe items.F-109Table of ContentsCombined Platform BusinessNotes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)For the Years Ended 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013(All amounts in thousands of RMB, except for share and per share data)2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)              Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that futureeconomic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Combined Platform Business and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.The carryingamount of the replaced part is derecognized.All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the combined statements of comprehensive income during thefinancial period in which they are incurred.Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method to allocate their costs to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:              The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting period.An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimatedrecoverable amount.Gains and losses on disposals and write-offs are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognized within generaland administrative expense in the combined statements of comprehensive income.2.6         Intangible assets(a)Domain namesDomain names purchased from related or third parties are initially recorded at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimatedeconomic useful lives of five years.(b)Trademarks and licencesSeparately acquired trademarks and licences are shown at historical cost.Trademarks and licences have a finite useful life and are carried atcost less accumulated amortization.Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the costs of trademarks and licencesover their estimated useful lives of five years.(c)Research and developmentResearch expenditure is recognized as an expense as incurred within \"technology and content\".Costs incurred on development projects (relating to the design and testing of new or improved products, or internally developed software) arecapitalized as intangible assets when recognition criteria are fulfilled and tests for impairment are performed annually.Other developmentexpenditures that do not meet those criteria are recognized as expenses as incurred within \"technology and contents\".Development costspreviously recognized as expenses are not recognized as assets in subsequent periods.Capitalized development costs are amortized from thepoint at which the assets are ready for use on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, not exceeding five years.F-110Servers 3–5 yearsElectronic and other equipment 3–5 yearsTable of ContentsCombined Platform BusinessNotes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)For the Years Ended 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013(All amounts in thousands of RMB, except for share and per share data)2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)During the years, the Combined Platform Business did not capitalize any development costs.2.7         Impairment of non-financial assets              Assets that have an indefinite useful life—for example, goodwill or intangible assets not ready to use are not subject to amortization and are testedannually for impairment.Assets that are subject to amortization or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstancesindicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds itsrecoverable amount.The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use.For the purposes of assessing impairment,assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).Non-financial assets other than goodwillthat suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.2.8         Accounts receivable              Accounts receivable are amounts due from customers for services performed in the ordinary course of business.If collection of accounts receivable isexpected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets.Accounts receivable arerecognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less allowance for impairment.2.9         Other receivables              Other receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less provisionfor impairment, if any.2.10       Other current liabilities              Other payables and accruals are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.2.11       Employee benefits(a)Employee leave entitlementsEmployee entitlements to annual leave are recognized when they are accrued to employees.A provision is made for the estimated liability forannual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period.Employee entitlements to sick and maternityleave are not recognized until the time of leave.(b)Pension obligationsThe Combined Platform Business contributes on a monthly basis to various defined contribution plans organized by the relevantgovernmental authorities or trustees.The Combined Platform Business' liability in respect of these plans is limited to the contributionsF-111Table of ContentsCombined Platform BusinessNotes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)For the Years Ended 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013(All amounts in thousands of RMB, except for share and per share data)2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)payable in each period.Contributions to these plans are expensed as incurred.Assets of the plans are held and managed by governmentauthorities or trustees and are separate from those of the Combined Platform Business.(c)Share-based compensation benefitsTencent Holdings operates a number of share-based compensation plans (including share option schemes and share award schemes), underwhich Tencent Group, including the Combined Platform Business, receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments(including share options and awarded shares) of Tencent Holdings.The fair value of the employee services received by the Combined PlatformBusiness in exchange for the grant of equity instruments of Tencent Holdings is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, which is theperiod over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied, and credited to invested equity as part of the contributions fromTencent Holdings into the Combined Platform Business.For the grant of share options, the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted by using anoption-pricing model—Black-Scholes valuation model (the \"BS Model\"), which includes the impact of market performance conditions (suchas Tencent Holding's share price) but excludes the impact of service condition and non-market performance conditions.For the grant of awardshares, the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the market price of Tencent Holdings' shares at the grant date.Non-market performance and services conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become vested.2.12       Provisions              Provisions are recognized when the Combined Platform Business has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is morelikely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated.Provisions are notrecognized for future operating losses.Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class ofobligations as a whole.A provision is recognized even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligationsmay be small.Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflectscurrent market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.The increase in the provision due to passage of time isrecognized as interest expense.F-112Table of ContentsCombined Platform BusinessNotes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)For the Years Ended 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013(All amounts in thousands of RMB, except for share and per share data)2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)2.13       Revenue recognition              The Combined Platform Business offers online marketplace that enable Third-party sellers to sell their products to Buyers on Paipai and Wanggouand also provides advertising placements for a specified period of time on its websites and in various formats, including but not limited to banners, links,logos, buttons, and content integration.Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and represents amounts receivable for services rendered, stated netof discounts and value added taxes.The Combined Platform Business recognizes revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; when it isprobable that future economic benefits will flow to the Combined Platform Business; and when specific criteria have been met for each of the CombinedPlatform Business' activities, as described below.(a)Commission incomeThe revenues of services and others primarily consist of fees charged to the Third-party sellers for participating in the Combined PlatformBusiness' online marketplace, where the Combined Platform Business generally is not the primary obligor, does not bear the inventory risk,does not have the ability to establish the price and control the related shipping services when utilized by the online marketplaces' Third-partysellers.Upon successful sales on Paipai and Wanggou, the Combined Platform Business will charge the Third-party sellers a negotiatedamount or a fixed rate commission fee based on the sales amount.Commission fee revenues are recognized on a net basis at the point ofdelivery of products, assuming all other revenue criteria have been met.An annual fixed fee is also charged to the Third-party sellers for theirparticipation in the online marketplaces and is recognized as revenue on a time proportion basis.(b)Online advertisingThe Combined Platform Business recognizes revenues over the period during which the advertising services were provided.Advertisingarrangements involving multiple deliverables are allocated into separate units of accounting based on their estimated fair values of theconsideration received or receivable, and the related revenue is recognized over the period during which the element is provided.Significantassumptions and estimates have been made in estimating the fair value of consideration of each unit of accounting, and changes in judgmentson these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing of advertising revenue recognition.The Combined Platform Businessdid not enter into material advertising-for-advertising barter transactions, or any other types of barter transactions.2.14       Promotion and marketing programs              The Combined Platform Business provides discount coupons for free to potential Buyers of the online marketplaces to incentivise purchases as partof their promotion and marketing programs.F-113Table of ContentsCombined Platform BusinessNotes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)For the Years Ended 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013(All amounts in thousands of RMB, except for share and per share data)2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)              The discount coupons require the Buyers to make future purchases of merchandises offered on the marketplace of the Combined Platform Business ata minimum value in order to enjoy the value indicated by the coupons.The Combined Platform Business is required to compensate the Third party sellers ofthe merchandises upon redemption of these discount coupons by the Buyers.Due to fact that the Combined Platform Business is acting as an agent in the operations of the marketplace and the discount coupons are expected tobenefit the whole marketplace, the compensation that is paid or payable to the Third party sellers is recognized as a marketing and promotional expense ofthe Combined Platform Business.2.15       Cost of revenues              Cost of revenues consists primarily of the costs associated with the broadband and server charges that are directly related to operating the marketplaceas well as storage and telecommunications infrastructure for internal use that supports the Combined Platform Business.These costs are expensed as incurred2.16       Marketing              Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising costs and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and business developmentactivities, including the costs of discount coupons (mentioned in 2.14).Advertising costs, which consist primarily of online advertising, offline television,movie and outdoor advertising, are expensed as incurred.2.17       Technology and content              Technology and content expenses consist primarily of technology infrastructure expenses and payroll and related expenses for employees involvedin platform development, product category expansion, editorial content, and systems support.2.18       General and administrative              General and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in general corporate functions, includingaccounting, finance, tax, legal and human relations, and costs such as depreciation expenses, rental and other general corporate related expenses for the use offacilities and equipments.2.19       Income tax              Income tax charges have been determined based on the separate tax return method in these combined financial statements.Current income tax is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries wherethe Combined Platform Business operate and generate taxable income.Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect tosituations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to bepaid to the tax authorities.F-114Table of ContentsCombined Platform BusinessNotes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)For the Years Ended 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013(All amounts in thousands of RMB, except for share and per share data)2 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)              Deferred income tax is recognized, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and theircarrying amounts in the combined financial statements.However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of goodwillor the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction neither accounting nortaxable profit or loss is affected.Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end ofthe reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.Deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporarydifferences can be utilized.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilitiesand when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or differenttaxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.3 Financial risk management3.1         Financial risk factors              The Combined Platform Business' activities expose it to credit risk and liquidity risk.The Combined Platform Business' aim is therefore to achieve anappropriate balance between risk and return and minimize the potential adverse effects on the Combined Platform Business' financial performance.Management considers that the Combined Platform Business is not exposed to any significant foreign exchange risk because it mainly operates in thePRC with most of the transactions settled in RMB.3.1.1      Credit risk              The Combined Platform Business is exposed to credit risk in relation to its accounts receivable and other receivables.The carrying amount of thesefinancial assets represents the maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to the corresponding financial assets of the Combined Platform Business.Buyers are required to pay in advance for their orders placed on Wanggou through an online payment platform operated by Tencent Holdings.Commission fees from majority of the Third-party sellers are calculated based on the order amount that will be settled by the end of each month.Paipaigenerally does not offer credit to its customers.As a result, the Combined Platform Business does not have significant accounts receivable.As at 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013, accounts receivable represents commission fees from a limited number of Third-party sellers of whichbalances are not settled through the online payment platform.These receivables are typically unsecured and the credit quality of each Third-party seller isassessed, which takes into account its financial position, past collection experience and other factors.Such business arrangement no longer existed as at31 December 2013.F-115Table of ContentsCombined Platform BusinessNotes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)For the Years Ended 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013(All amounts in thousands of RMB, except for share and per share data)3 Financial risk management (Continued)3.1.2      Liquidity risk              There is no independent treasury function of the Combined Platform Business as it is managed centrally by Tencent Group.As at 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013, all of the financial liabilities of the Combined Platform Business have contractual maturity date within oneyear.As stated in the SSA, all financial liabilities of the Combined Platform Business will be settled by Tencent Holdings upon closing of the Transaction.3.2         Capital risk management              The Combined Platform Business' objectives when managing capital (including funding from Tencent Holdings and related parties) are to safeguardthe Combined Platform Business' ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for Tencent Holdings and benefits for other stakeholdersand to maintain an optimal capital structure to enhance equity value in the long term.3.3         Fair value estimation              The Combined Platform Business adopts the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the combined balance sheets at fairvalue, which requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:•Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1).•Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) orindirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2).•Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).As at 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013, the Combined Platform Business did not have any significant financial assets or financial liabilities in thebalance sheet which is measured at fair value.The carrying amounts of the Combined Platform Business' financial assets, including accounts receivable and other receivables; and the CombinedPlatform Business' financial liabilities, including accounts payable, accrued expenses and other payables approximate their fair values due to their shortmaturities.The nominal values less any estimated credit adjustments for financial assets and liabilities with a maturity of less than one year are assumed toapproximate their fair values.The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at thecurrent market interest rate that is available to the Combined Platform Business for similar financial instruments.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgments              Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future eventsthat are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.F-116Table of ContentsCombined Platform BusinessNotes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)For the Years Ended 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013(All amounts in thousands of RMB, except for share and per share data)4 Critical accounting estimates and judgments (Continued)              Management of the Combined Platform Business makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.The resulting accounting estimates will, bydefinition, seldom equal the related actual results.The estimates and assumptions that have significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carryingamounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below:a)Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets              Management of the Combined Platform Business determines the estimated useful lives, and related depreciation and amortization expense for itsproperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets, respectively.This estimate is based on the historical experience of the actual useful lives of property,plant and equipment and intangible assets of similar nature and functions.Management of the Combined Platform Business will increase the depreciationand amortization expense where useful lives are less than previously estimated lives, and will write-off or write-down technically obsolete or nonstrategicassets that have been abandoned or sold.Actual economic lives may differ from estimated useful lives.Periodic review could result in a change indepreciable lives and therefore depreciation and amortization expense in future periods.b)Accounts and other receivables              Management of the Combined Platform Business determines the provision for impairment of accounts and other receivables based on an assessmentof the recoverability of the receivables.The assessment is based on the credit history of its customers, other debtors and the current market condition andrequires the use of judgments and estimates.Management of the Combined Platform Business reassesses the provision at the end of each reporting period.c)Revenue recognition              Advertising revenues are derived principally from arrangements where the customers pay to place their advertisements on the Combined PlatformBusiness' platforms in different formats over a particular period of time.Such formats generally include but not limited to banners, links, logos and buttons.Advertisements on the Combined Platform Business' platforms are generally charged on the basis of duration, and advertising contracts are signed toestablish the fixed price and the advertising services to be provided.Where the Combined Platform Business' customers purchase multiple advertising spaces with different display periods in the same contract, theCombined Platform Business allocates the total consideration to the various advertising elements based on their relative fair values and recognizes revenuefor the different elements over their respective display periods.The Combined Platform Business determines the fair values of different advertising elementsbased on the prices charged when these elements were sold on a standalone basis.The Combined Platform Business recognizes revenue on the elementsdelivered and defers the recognition of revenue for the fair value of the undelivered elements until the remaining obligations have been satisfied.Where all ofthe elements within an arrangement are delivered uniformly over the agreement period, the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contractperiod.F-117Table of ContentsCombined Platform BusinessNotes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)For the Years Ended 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013(All amounts in thousands of RMB, except for share and per share data)4 Critical accounting estimates and judgments (Continued)d)Share-based compensation expenses              As mentioned in Note 2.11(c), Tencent Holdings has granted share options to the employees of the Combined Platform Business.Management ofTencent Holdings has used the BS Model to determine the total fair value of the options granted, which is to be expensed and charged to the CombinedPlatform Business over the vesting period.Significant judgment on parameters, such as risk free rate, dividend yield and expected volatility, is required to bemade by the management of Tencent Holdings in applying the BS Model (Note 15).In addition, Tencent Holdings also granted shares to the employees ofthe Combined Platform Business under its share award schemes at fair value.Tencent Group estimates the expected yearly percentage of grantees of share options/awarded shares who will stay within Tencent Group at the end ofthe vesting periods (\"Expected Retention Rate of Grantees\") in order to determine the amount of share-based compensation expenses charged into its incomestatement and allocated to the Combined Platform Business.As at 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013, the Expected Retention Rate of Grantees was assessedto be 91 percent.e)Deferred income tax              Deferred income tax assets relating to certain temporary differences and tax losses are recognized when the management considers it is probable thatfuture taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences or tax losses can be utilized.When the expectation is different from theoriginal estimate, such differences will impact the recognition of deferred income tax assets and taxation charges in the period in which such estimate ischanged.Management assessed that the realization of losses against future taxable profit is not probable.Furthermore, the Combined Platform Business doesnot constitute a tax entity in the PRC, any tax losses incurred by the Combined Platform Business will not be available against future taxable income.As aresult, no deferred income tax assets had been recognized as at 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013.5 Accounts receivable              As at 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013, insignificant amounts of accounts receivable were past due but not impaired after management of theCombined Platform Business had performed assessment on their credit quality with reference to historical counterparty default rates.As at 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013, accounts receivable were denominated in RMB and the carrying amounts approximate their fair values.6 Prepayments and other receivables              Other receivables were mainly denominated in RMB and the carrying amounts approximate their fair values as at 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013.Other receivables were neither past due nor impaired.F-118  2011 2012 2013 Other receivables  926  88  307 Prepayments  140  268  2,253         Total

Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements (All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data) 1.Basis of Pro Forma Presentation              On March 10, 2014, the Company entered into a Strategic Cooperation Agreement (\"Agreement\") with Tencent Holdings Limited (\"Tencent\"), for aperiod of 5 years from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2019.Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company will become Tencent's preferred partner in the developmentof physical goods e-Commerce business in Greater China, including: (a) Tencent will grant the Company prominent level-1 access points in Weixin andmobile QQ applications; (b) Tencent will provide internet traffic and other support from other key platforms to the Company; (c) the Company will cooperatewith Tencent in a number of areas primarily mobile-related products, social networking services, membership systems and payment solutions.Termsdescribed in (a), (b) and (c) above are hereinafter collectively referred to as \"Strategic Cooperation\".In addition, for a period of 8 years from April 1, 2014 toMarch 31, 2022, other than the operation of Shanghai Icson, a subsidiary of Tencent, Tencent will not engage in any online direct sales or managedmarketplace business model in physical goods e-Commerce businesses in Greater China and a few selected international markets, hereinafter referred to as\"Non-Compete\".On the same date, the Company also entered into a series of agreements with Tencent and its affiliates, pursuant to which, the Company acquired fromTencent: (i) 100% business operation of two online marketplace platforms, Paipai and QQ Wanggou (\"Combined Platform Business\"); (ii) 9.9% equityinterest in Shanghai Icson (\"Investment in Shanghai Icson\"); (iii) a call option (\"Call Option\") to acquire the remaining equity interest of Shanghai Icson, witha price higher of the fair value of the remaining equity interest as determined when the option is exercised or RMB800 million within three yearscommencing the closing of the Transaction; (iv) certain logistic workforce; and (v) a land use right.The above (i) to (v), Strategic Cooperation and Non-Compete are collectively referred to as \"Transaction\".As consideration for the Transaction, the Company issued 351,678,637 ordinary shares to Huang River Investment Limited, a wholly-ownedsubsidiary of Tencent, representing 15% shares on a diluted basis under treasury method upon the closing of the Transaction, on March 10, 2014.The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect adjustments to give effect to pro forma events that are (1) directlyattributable to the Transaction, (2) factually supportable, and (3) with respect to the unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations andcomprehensive loss, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results.The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements doesnot assume the future exercise of the Call Option and accordingly does not give effect to the acquisition of the remaining equity interest of Shanghai Icson.The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are based on, and should be read in conjunction with, the respective historical consolidated financialstatements and the notes thereto of the Company and Combined Platform Business, which are included in this prospectus.The pro forma adjustments arebased on management's estimates and valuation of the Transaction, assisted by an independent third-party appraiser.The acquisition of Combined Platform Business is accounted for as a business combination.The Investment in Shanghai Icson was accounted forunder the cost method and recorded in equity investment.The identifiable intangible assets acquired are amortized on a straight-line basis over the respectiveuseful lives.The Company has assumed that the fair value of all the assets and liabilities of Combined Platform Business as of the closing date of theTransaction, other than identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, approximate the carrying value of those assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2013.P-6Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)1.Basis of Pro Forma Presentation (Continued)              The acquisitions of Strategic Cooperation, Non-compete, Investment in Shanghai Icson, Logistic Workforce and Land use right are considered assetacquisitions separate from the acquisition of Combined Platform Business.The Company has performed the following steps to estimate the cost of the assetsand business acquired with the assistance from an independent valuation firm: 1) estimate the total fair value of 351,678,637 ordinary shares issued to HuangRiver Investment Limited as the consideration of the transaction on March 10, 2014 using the income approach, or the discounted cash flow, or DCF,method; 2) estimate the stand-alone fair value of the Combined Platform Business as well as fair value of each of Strategic Cooperation Agreement, Non-Compete, Investment in Shanghai Icson, Logistic workforce and Land Use Right (collectively \"Asset Acquisition\"); 3) The excess of (1) over sum of (2) andnet cash acquired in the transaction has been allocated to individual assets of the Asset Acquisition and the Combined Platform Business based on theirrelative fair values.Additionally, in accordance with ASC 820, ASC 505-50, ASC 718 and SAB Topic 14.A, non-transferability relating to lock-up periodassociated with the shares issued to Huang River Investment Limited for a period of three years commencing from March 10, 2014, is factored in estimatingthe fair value of shares issued to acquire Strategic Cooperation, Non-compete, Investment in Shanghai Icson, Logistic Workforce and Land use right, but isnot factored in estimating the fair value of shares issued to acquire Combined Platform Business.The Company considered the following valuation method and significant assumptions in evaluating the intangibles acquired from the Transaction:Asset Acquisition:              Strategic Cooperation Agreement—In addition to the Company's general business cooperation with Tencent primarily in areas of mobile-relatedproducts, social networking services, membership systems and payment solutions, the other parts of the Strategic Cooperation Agreement is in substance aprepaid advertising/promotion service where Tencent users can be diverted to the Company's websites/platforms where (a) Tencent will grant the Companyprominent level-1 access points in Weixin and mobile QQ applications and (b) Tencent will provide internet traffic and other support from its other keyplatforms to the Company.These advertising/promotion services include push messages, advertising, payment processing, and application activation.Thegeneral business cooperation is not recognized as a separate intangible asset because such provisions only set out the general principal for the cooperationbetween the Company and Tencent with no specific deliverables provided to the Company.The amount recognized for the Strategic Cooperation Agreementrelates to the advertising/promotion services and the fair value was established using a form of the income approach known as the cost saving method.Thismethod recognizes that, because of the Strategic Cooperation Agreement, the Company can save advertising fees, traffic acquisition costs, paymentprocessing fees and application activation fees that otherwise it would need to be paid to a third party for the similar services.The estimated unit market priceof the advertising/promotion services were multiplied by the volume of the services to be provided by Tencent to arrive at the cost saving attributable to theStrategic Cooperation Agreement.The most significant assumptions inherent in this approach include: 1) the estimated market price of the services to beprovided, 2) the volume of the services to be provided, and 3) discount rate.When applying the cost saving method for the valuation of the StrategicCooperation Agreement, market participant assumptions were used in accordance with ASC 820.Specifically, the basis of the assumptions were determinedwith consideration of the terms of theP-7Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)1.Basis of Pro Forma Presentation (Continued)Strategic Cooperation Agreement, an industry report regarding China's e-commerce sector and a market rate that market participants have to pay to thirdparties for similar services on arm's length basis.The present value of the after-tax cost savings at an appropriate discount rate indicates the value of StrategicCooperation Agreement.The discount rate was derived by using the capital asset pricing model (the \"CAPM\"), which is a method that market participantscommonly use to price assets.Based on the CAPM, the Company concluded a discount rate of 17.5% was appropriate for valuing the Strategic CooperationAgreement.Non-compete—Other than the operation of Shanghai Icson, Tencent will not engage in any online direct sales or managed marketplace businessmodels in physical goods e-Commerce business in Greater China and a few selected international markets.The fair value of the Non-compete was determinedbased on the \"with and without\" method, which takes into consideration the cash flow increments between the scenario where the Non-compete is not inplace and the scenario where the Non-compete is in place for a period of 8 years from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2022.The most significant assumptioninherent in this approach when valuing the Non-compete was the amount of economic impact to the Company that would occur from competition during theperiod when non-compete agreement is effective.Based on the CAPM, the Company concluded a discount rate of 17.5%, which reflects a market participant'srequired rate of return for the risks of investing in the Non-compete, was appropriate for discounting the cash flow attributable to the Non-compete.Investment in Shanghai Icson—In determining the fair value of the investment in Shanghai Icson, the Company followed a two-step process.In thefirst step, the discounted cash flow method, or DCF, was used as the primary approach to determine the fair value of the equity interest of Shanghai Icson andmarket approach to cross-check the valuation results derived by the DCF method.The free cashflow of Shanghai Icson was discounted by 22%, which wasdetermined by the CAPM to reflect a market participant's required rate of return for the risks of investing in the equity interest of Shanghai Icson.In thesecond step, since the Company's investment in Shanghai Icson is in the form of preferred shares, an option pricing method to allocate the equity interest ofShanghai Icson to its common shares and preferred shares was used.The significant assumptions inherent in option pricing models are the expected time ofliquidity event, risk free rate and volatility factor of equity interest of Shanghai Icson.Logistic workforce—The fair value of logistic workforce was estimated using replacement cost approach.The significant assumptions inherent inreplacement cost approach for valuing the Logistic workforce are the recruitment, interview, and training costs required to re-develop the workforce withsimilar level of productivity, and costs due to loss of productivity during the training period.Land use right—The fair value of land use right was determined based on the purchase cost that Tencent paid to acquire the land use right from thirdparty on arm's length basis shortly before this acquisition.Intangible assets included in the Combined Platform Business:              Technology, Domain names and Trademark—The fair values of the acquired technology, domain names and trademark were established using aform of the income approach known as the relief-from-royalty method.This method recognizes that, because it owns the technology, domain names andtrademark rather than licensing them, a company does not have to pay a royalty, usually expressedP-8Table of ContentsJD.com, Inc.Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements (Continued)(All amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data)1.Basis of Pro Forma Presentation (Continued)as a percentage of sales, for their use.The most significant assumptions inherent in this approach when valuing the technology and domain names andtrademark include royalty saving rates and discount rates.With reference to royalty rate of comparable market transaction of the industry, profitability of theacquired business and relative importance of the subject intangible assets to the acquired business, the Company determined that a royalty saving rate of 4%and 3% for valuing the technology, domain names and trademark, respectively.The after-tax royalty savings of the technology, domain names and trademarkwere then discounted at 19.5% and 19%, respectively.Such discount rates were determined based on a market participant's required rate of return for the risksof acquired business, as determined by the CAPM, plus relative risk premiums of the subject intangible assets.Advertising customer relationship—The fair value of the advertising customer relationship was established using a form of the income approachknown as the excess earnings method.In the excess earnings method, value is estimated as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of thesubject intangible asset in excess of the returns required on the investment in the contributory assets necessary to realize those benefits.The most significantassumptions inherent in this approach when valuing advertising customer relationship include attrition rate of existing advertising customer, profit margin ofrevenue attributable to existing advertising customer, discount rate and required rate of return on contributory assets.The resulting excess earning wasdiscounted at 19.5%.The discount rate was determined based on a market participant's required rate of return for the risks of acquired business, as determinedby the CAPM, plus relative risk premium of the advertising customer relationship.The table below summarizes the estimated fair value of Combined Platform Business, Investment in Shanghai Icson and other identifiable intangibleassets acquired as of the closing date of the Transaction, March 10, 2014.In accordance with ASC 805-10-25-23, transaction costs relating to the businesscombination of the Combined Platform Business will be expensed as incurred while in accordance with ASC 805-50-30-2, transaction costs relating to theacquisition of individual

   Certain reclassifications were made to the combined financial statements of the Combined Platform Business to conform to the Company's financialstatements presentation.These adjustments include: 1) reclassification of third party transaction fees and payroll and related expenses for employeesinvolved in the operation of the Combined Platform Business from the cost of revenues to Fulfillment; and

company's articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors,except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification againstcivil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime.Our current memorandum and articles of association that have become effective upon the completion of our initial public offering, provide that eachofficer or director of our company shall be indemnified against all actions, proceedings, costs, charges, expenses, losses, damages or liabilities incurred orsustained by such director or officer, other than by reason of such person's own dishonesty, willful default or fraud, in or about the conduct of our company'sbusiness or affairs (including as a result of any mistake of judgment) or in the execution or discharge of his duties, powers, authorities or discretions,including without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, any costs, expenses, losses or liabilities incurred by such director or officer in defending(whether successfully or otherwise) any civil proceedings concerning our company or its affairs in any court whether in the Cayman Islands or elsewhere.Pursuant to indemnification agreements the form of which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this registration statement, we agree to indemnify our directorsand executive officers against certain liabilities and expenses incurred by such persons in connection with claims made by reason of their being such adirector or officer.The underwriting agreement, the form of which will be filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this registration statement, will also provide for indemnification by theunderwriters of us and our officers and directors for certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act, but only to the extent that suchliabilities are caused by information relating to the underwriters furnished to us in writing expressly for use in this registration statement and certain otherdisclosure documents.Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant tothe foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the SecuritiesAct and is therefore unenforceable.ITEM 7.RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES.During the past three years, we have issued the following securities.No underwriters were involved in these

(the “Company”), a company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, in connection with (a) theoffering (the “Offering”) of certain number of the Company’s American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”), each representing two Class A ordinary shares ofpar value US$0.00002 per share of the Company (“Ordinary Shares”) (together with the ADSs, the “Offered Securities”), in accordance withCompany’s Registration Statement on Form F-1 under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, including all amendments or supplements thereto, originallyfiled by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 21, 2014 (the “Registration Statement”), and (b) thesupplemental listing of the Offered Securities on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.3.In so acting, we have examined the Registration Statement, the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of documentsprovided to us by the Company and such other documents, corporate records, certificates, approvals and other instruments as we have deemednecessary for the purpose of rendering this opinion, including, without limitation, originals or copies of the agreements and certificates issued by PRCauthorities and officers of the Company (“Documents”).In such examination, we have assumed the accuracy of the factual matters described in theRegistration Statement and that the Registration Statement and other documents will be executed by the parties in the forms provided to and reviewedby us.We have also assumed the genuineness of all signatures, seals and chops, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, and theconformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies, and the truthfulness, accuracy and completeness of all factual statements inthe documents.北京 BEIJING   ·   上海SHANGHAI   ·   深圳SHENZHEN   ·   广州GUANGZHOU   ·   武汉WUHAN   ·   成都 CHENGDU重庆 CHONGQING   ·   青岛 QINGDAO   ·   东京TOKYO   ·   香港HONG KONG   ·  伦敦 LONDON   ·  纽约 NEWYORK4.The following terms as used in this Opinion are defined as follows: “Jiangsu Yuanzhou”means Jiangsu Yuanzhou E-Commerce Co., Ltd.  “Jingdong 360” means Beijing Jingdong 360 Degree E-Commerce Co., Ltd.   “Jingdong Century” means Beijing Jingdong Century Trade Co., Ltd.   “M&A Rules”means the Rules on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors jointlypromulgated by the Ministry of Commerce, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission,the State Administration of Taxation, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce, China SecuritiesRegulatory Commission (“CSRC”) and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the PRC onAugust 8, 2006 and amended on June 22, 2009.“PRCGroup Companies”means the PRC Subsidiaries, the Variable Interest Entities and the subsidiaries of the Variable InterestEntities.“PRC Group Company” shall be construed accordingly.“PRC Laws”means any and all laws, regulations, statutes, rules, decrees, notices, and supreme court’s judicialinterpretations currently in force and publicly available in the PRC as of the date hereof.“PRC Subsidiaries” mean any and all subsidiaries of the Company established in the PRC which are, directly or indirectly,owned by the Company.“PRC WFOEs”means Jingdong Century, Shanghai Shengdayuan Information Technology Co., Ltd., Tianjin Star EastCorporation Limited, Beijing Jingbangda Trade Co., Ltd., Shanghai Jiazhan Financial Leasing Co., Ltd. andNanjing Paipai Blue Sky Information Technology Co., Ltd.  “Prospectus”means the prospectus, including all amendments or supplements thereto, that forms part of the RegistrationStatement.“Variable Interest Entities”include Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou.2Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings described in the Registration Statement.5.Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that: (1)                   Corporate Structure.The descriptions of the corporate structure of the PRC Group Companies set forth in “Corporate History and Structure”section of the Prospectus are true and accurate and nothing has been omitted from such descriptions which would make the same misleading inany material respects.We have advised the Company that, both currently and immediately after giving effect to this Offering, (i) the ownership structures of JingdongCentury and the Variable Interest Entities in China comply with all existing PRC Laws; and (ii) the contractual arrangements between JingdongCentury, the Variable Interest Entities and their respective shareholders governed by PRC Laws are valid, binding and enforceable, and will notresult in any violation of PRC Laws.The statements set forth in the Prospectus under the captions “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure — If the PRCgovernment deems that the contractual arrangements in relation to Jingdong 360 and Jiangsu Yuanzhou do not comply with PRC regulatoryrestrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in thefuture, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations” are fair and accurate summaries of thematters described therein, and nothing has been omitted from such summaries that would make the same misleading in any material respect.(2)                   M&A Rules.We have advised the Company as to the content of the M&A Rules, in particular the relevant provisions thereof that purport torequire offshore special purpose vehicles formed for the purpose of obtaining a stock exchange listing outside of PRC and controlled directly orindirectly by Chinese companies or natural persons, to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of their securities on anystock exchange located outside of PRC.We have advised the Company based on our understanding of the PRC Laws that the CSRC’s approval is not required for the listing and tradingof the Company’s ADSs on the NASDAQ in the context of this Offering, given that (1) PRC WFOEs were incorporated as wholly foreign-ownedenterprises by means of direct investment rather than by merger or acquisition of equity interest or assets of a PRC domestic company owned 3by PRC companies or individuals as defined under the M&A Rules that are the beneficial owners of the Company; and (2) no provision in theM&A Rules clearly classifies contractual arrangements as a type of transaction subject to the M&A Rules.The statements set forth in the Prospectus under the captions “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China — The approval of theChina Securities Regulatory Commission may be required in connection with this Offering under a regulation adopted in August 2006, and, ifrequired, we cannot predict whether we will be able to obtain such approval” are fair and accurate summaries of the matters described therein,and nothing has been omitted from such summaries that would make the same misleading in any material respect.(3)                   Enforceability of Civil Procedures.We have advised the Company that there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the PRC would:(i) recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against the Company or directors or officers of the Company predicatedupon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States; or (ii) entertain original actionsbrought in each respective jurisdiction against the Company or directors or officers of the Company predicated upon the securities laws of theUnited States or any state in the United States.We have further advised the Company that the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC CivilProcedures Law.PRC courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil ProceduresLaw based either on treaties between the PRC and the country where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions.The PRC does not have any treaties or other form of reciprocity with the United States that provide for the reciprocal recognition andenforcement of foreign judgments.In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC will not enforce a foreignjudgment against the Company or the Company’s directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of PRClaw or national sovereignty, security or public interest.As a result, it is uncertain whether and on what basis a PRC court would enforce ajudgment rendered by a court in the United States.Under the PRC Civil Procedures Law, foreign shareholders may originate actions based onPRC law against the Company in the PRC, if they can establish sufficient nexus to the PRC for a PRC court to have jurisdiction, and meet otherprocedural requirements, including, among others, the plaintiff must have 4a direct interest in the case, and there must be a concrete claim, a factual basis and a cause for the suit.(4)                   Taxation.The statements set forth under the caption “Taxation” in the Registration Statement insofar as they constitute statement of PRC taxlaw, are accurate in all material respects and that such statements constitute our opinion.We do not express any opinion herein concerning anylaw other than PRC tax law.(5)                   Statements in the Prospectus.The statements in the Prospectus under the headings “Prospectus Summary”, “Risk Factors”, “Corporate Historyand Structure”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Enforceability of CivilLiabilities”, “Dividend Policy”, “Business”, “Management”, “Related Party Transactions”, “Regulation”, “Taxation” and “Legal Matters”(other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data contained therein to which we express no opinion) to theextent such statements relate to matters of the PRC Laws or documents, agreements or proceedings governed by the PRC Laws, are true andaccurate in all material respects, and fairly present and fairly summarize in all material respects the PRC Laws, documents, agreements orproceedings referred to therein, and nothing has been omitted from such statements which would make the statements, in light of thecircumstance under which they were made, misleading in any material respect.6.This opinion is subject to the following qualifications: (a)                               This Opinion relates only to the PRC Laws and we express no opinion as to any other laws and regulations.There is no guarantee that any ofthe PRC Laws, or the interpretation thereof or enforcement therefor, will not be changed, amended or replaced in the immediate future or inthe longer term with or without retrospective effect.(b)                               This Opinion is intended to be used in the context which is specifically referred to herein and each section should be looked on as a wholeregarding the same subject matter and no part shall be extracted for interpretation separately from this Opinion.(c)                                This Opinion is subject to the effects of (i) certain legal or statutory principles affecting the enforceability of contractual rights generallyunder the concepts of public interest, national security, good faith and fair dealing, applicable statutes of limitation, and the limitations bybankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditor’s rights generally;
